Since you mentioned automatic weapons : To clarify , an automatic weapon means you pull the trigger one time , and hold it back without letting go , and the bullets keep coming out until you let go or until the weapon runs out of ammunition ) . In a word : no . It is illegal to import , buy , sell , transfer , or own a machine gun in the U.S. unless strict requirements are met . Mostly , these guns are owned by movie companies and wealthy old men . Primarily , aside from law enforcement agencies , no one may import , buy , sell , transfer , or own a machine gun which was not already registered with the federal government in 1986 - nearly 30 years ago . How do you own an automatic weapon ? You have to coincidentally live in a state that allows it - not all do - and if you do then the State and Federal government need to conduct a 4 - month background investigation because you can not : be underage ; have been convicted of , or be under indictment for , a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year ; be a fugitive from justice ; be an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance ; have been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution ; be in the U.S. illegally ; been dishonorably discharged from the military ; have renounced his or her U.S. citizenship ; be subject to a court order restraining him or her from harassing , stalking or threatening an intimate partner , his or her child or a child of a partner or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child ; or have been convicted of a misdemeanor offense of domestic violence . So , you fill out some fairly extensive paperwork , have your local police headquarters take two sets of fingerprints , have two passport photos taken , get your local police head to agree with your desire to purchase ( not all will ) , and then you send all that ( plus $ 200 ) to the federal government for your 4 - month background investigation . If that all comes back fine , congratulations ! You now have the right to buy a 30 - year - old ( or older ) firearm which essentially is a movie prop . Go forth , and find someone who wants to sell to you . All you need now is between $ 5,000US ( $ 6,000NZD ) and $ 50,000US ( $ 60,000NZD ) . Then , buy some ammunition , because every time you pull that trigger and hang on , it 's going to cost you at minimum $ 15US ( $ 19NZD ) . Now , how many crimes have been committed with these guns owned by civilians ? There are roughly 120,000 of these automatic weapons owned by civilians in the U.S. Since 1934 , the number of crimes committed with one of these guns by a civilian ? One . Hell , there was an attack on a banker in LONDON ENGLAND using machine guns in March of 2012 ! So , I hope this answers your question about machine guns . If you 'd like to continue to talk about firearms in a calm way in which we both trade facts and opinions , I 'd like that very much ."", []]",t5_2qh1i,AskReddit,1357153142
c7pwhev,t3_15tsyc,t3_15tsyc,5,"['That wearing fur in certain situations is okay , and I \'m okay with seal hunting to a degree . No , I \'m not cool with fur farming and the whole fashion end of fur because I honestly just see it as wasteful and not serving any purpose . But my dad is a hunter / fisher / trapper . He \'s always trapped animals and sold the fur , and was able to sell certain parts of animal ( e.g. beaver caster ) and used the rest of the animal as bait for other animals like bear . ( which he \'d hunt , sell the fir , and we ATE for a year . ) He taught me to be respectful of nature and he \'s a huge reason for why I am an environmental activist . Also , a lot of people get up in arms around seal hunting and use of seal fur , well in many parts of Canada \'s north it has nothing to do with the controversial "" seal cull "" . A lot of people kinda apply the seal cull to all seal hunting and do n\'t get their facts right . In Nunavut for example , seals are hunted for food , clothing , and boots . Fur insulates better than fake fur when you get to a certain low temperature . If you go to Nunavut in the crap jackets and boots from southern Canada , you \'ll be trading them in for real fur pretty freaking fast . In Nunavut there is a huge issue of poverty and hunger . A recent study documented that a huge majority of pregnant women went up to 3 days without any food . Food costs are astronomical and leave a terrible carbon footprint to be shipped or flown up . By the time the food gets there , it \'s rotten . Yes , the Inuit \'s ability to hunt has been strengthened by modern technology , but is still incredibly expensive compared to other places . The gas for a snow mobile or motor boat , the actual weapons if store bought etc . Really , I totally get people not wanting animals dying for stupid reasons , for made up reasons , and for vanity . But in Nunavut a great deal of hunting is done for survival . I do n\'t usually let the "" culture "" argument fly either ... but in Nunavut there are still people alive who lived on the land . People lived on the land right up to the 60s . SO yes , forcing our lifestyle on them has caused some identity problems which are a contributing factor to the 5 times the country average suicide rates ( especially among men ) . It \'s a multi - faceted issue . When people suggest that we ban them from hunting , we \'re also revoking their land agreement and the rights they worked so hard to achieve . When you take away 1 right , it opens the door for the rest of the rights to be taken away . I could rant forever . But I guess my main point is that I \'m not totally against people wearing fur , and I \'m not totally against people hunting seals . Both which are very taboo , especially in the circles I run in for environmentalism and activism . I have n\'t listed every fact but all one has to do is a quick search for academic articles on the subject and you \'ll see they overwhelmingly support my view .', []]",t5_2qh1i,AskReddit,1357161372

c7q5sm5,t3_15u16f,t3_15u16f,18,"[""One of the biggest problems is that popularity can be influenced by PERCEPTION of power , not necessarily power itself . One of my favourite examples of this is Starcraft 2 . In Starcraft 2 the Terran side is often blamed for being overpowered . It 's not . No really , there 's no way it could possibly be OP , the numbers and science are undeniable . So why do people still feel this way ? My answer is simple : Siege Tanks . When the Terran win a fight , they often do so with an overwhelming quantity of ranged weapon fire , usually from Siege Tanks . This frequently results in minimal damage to their own forces while they inflict maximum damage on their opponent in the first moments of combat . This does n't make the Terran player any more likely to win any given fight , it simply means that when they do win , it has a very different subjective quality to losing to the Zerg or Protoss sides . This fits with what we know about real world combat ! The entire point of concentrated fire is n't that it does more damage , rather it is the fact that it deals all the damage at once , which is significantly more demoralizing than slower attrition . For this reason , new players who have n't learned this fact will tend to feel overwhelmed by Terran opposition , which is what leads to the numerous complaints . What is most impressive about this is that the ' counter ' is as simple as reading the battlefield correctly . No actual gameplay change is required , the player themselves must dissociate the sudden burst of cannon fire from losing the fight within their own mind . This is a beautiful and wonderful thing for a game to do . Balancing on the basis of popularity will completely destroy this fascinating aspect of gaming . I 'm firmly against it . TL;DR Perception of power is different from the reality of that power . Popular opinion will often side with what feels strong in favor of what is truly useful .

However , since 1934 , [ only two crimes have ever been reported that utilized a legally - owned automatic weapon ] ( URL_2 ) . One of these was committed by a police officer . This stat is pretty good evidence to me that the weapons themselves are not the cause of crime . Moreover , fully automatic weapons were generally pretty expensive or at least considered somewhat impractical even before they were regulated , such that not many people were interested in purchasing them . For example , read about the history and sluggish civilian market sales of the Thompson Submachinegun upon its introduction . Keep in mind , "" expensive and difficult to obtain legally "" is not the same thing as "" difficult for criminals to get "" . Someone who was determined to get an illegal full auto could easily obtain one from criminals in Mexico , South America , or other illicit sources . Or , they could illegally modify semi automatic weapons . This is n\'t "" easy "" to do , but totally doable for somebody who is determined . The [ North Hollywood Shootout Bank Robbers ] ( URL_1 ) illegally modified existing weapons to make them full - auto .

Their manufacture and availability to civilians was cut off in 1986 , so all real assault weapons in civilian hands are at least 26 years old . Just to specify , an assault rifle , as designated by the US Army , is select - fire ( full auto capable via a switch ) and fires a cartridge of size between a pistol caliber and a full size rifle caliber . For your benefit , I will lump pistol and full size rifle calibers into "" assault weapons "" for civilians , to include all select fire guns such as the Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun in 9 mm , and the original M14 in 7.62 * 51 mm ( note : the original M14 was select fire ; the new ones being made are semi - auto only , even the ones being used in the military ) . These all get the NFA regulations , which are stringent to say the least . Some will argue that semi - auto firepower is inherently dangerous and conducive to mass shootings . However , semi - automatic firearms have existed since 1885 . Mass shootings did not start popping up on a considerable scale ( even now they \'re still very rare but disproportionately publicized ) until 100 years after that . It \'s by no means new technology , and it is n\'t the cause of the shootings . Banning them makes no sense , since an evil - doer will hit the black market and get a semi - auto , or maybe even a full auto , if he wants one , and the rest of the populace will be left with only revolvers and hunting arms , which is far from equal footing with a black - market - armed home invader or street thug . The real concern is a cultural shift . The technology is a century old , but the mass shooting trend started only about 30 years ago . We need to evaluate the mental health of the nation on a deeper level in order to find the high risk individuals who are likely to commit mass murder . As a side note , violent crime in the US has been going down since 1992 . Feinstein \'s source claims her assault weapons ban , * all factors held equal * reduced crime by 6.7 % , but the trend was steady throughout 2 preban years and has stuck for about 20 years , so it ca n\'t be held equal ; it only accounts for the general trend regardless .

This massive drop coincides with an equally massive shift in rifle sales after the expiration of the previous Assault Weapon Ban .

The same act could easily have been performed with pistols or a pump action shotgun with absolutely no change in the outcome . - The Aurora shooter had an AR , but he also used a notoriously unreliable 100 round magazine that jammed within the first 15 rounds he initially fired into the ceiling . Most of the injuries sustained were from the pistol he carried and the pump action shotgun . - The Columbine shooting was committed with two sawed off shotguns and two Tec 9s . The Tec9 is a really crappy pistol with no practical application that is n\'t very ergonomic , reliable or especially useful ( it is sold because it looks "" cool "" ) . One shooter only had 10 round magazines . The other shooter had higher capacity magazines , but did not use them ( they are very unreliable ) . - The biggest mass shooting in US history , Virginia Tech , was committed with a Glock 19 ( a compact , 9 mm pistol with a 15 round magazine capacity ) and a Walther P22 ( a .22 caliber pistol with a 10 round magazine capacity ) . Mass shootings are extraordinarily rare events ; drawing conclusive data from them from which to drive policy is virtually impossible .

Staging is gathering of resources in a fashion that will not overwhelm a given seen , yet allow for all the work to be done that needs to be done .

Staging is common . Regarding shootings ... each department has its own policy . In the communities I have worked in , fire / ems can not be on scene of a shooting until the police have cleared the area . We wait around the corner or in some safe spot until the shooter is taken care of .

I always thought the klingons got the better end of the deal because their 3pc bonus and the 3 consoles themselves sync a lot better , but for the oddy , you have one defensive ability , and two pets that give you a slight buff , but you ca n't use them together . Keep the work bees though . They help you out quite a bit . I would suggest that you replace those field generators with the Tier 3 embassy rep science consoles . There is one that gives you a bonus to shield emitters , threat , and your choice of adding a plasma DOT , hull repair , or in my opinion , the best one for you , a shield heal . Pretty pricy , but immensely worth it . Hell , if you can only get T2 embassy sci consoles , they are almost as good as the T3 ones , give or take a couple points . Also , if you have it , you might consider using the console that comes with the steamrunner in place of one of those neutronium alloys . Team wide , prevents shield bleedthrough , AND reduces all damage to shields by 20 % ? Yes please . That is insanely good for damage reduction for your entire team . * * Weapon choices :* * When I had mine , I did n't have access to the spiral wave ones , so I used polarized disruptors . Pretty much on par with yours , just a minor amount of dps loss due to the fact they were mk xi . I would say that you should lose one of the rear beam arrays and stick to the cutting beam . It is really good and adds on some nice kinetic damage . Now this next part is pretty pricy to get , but if you can , it would help out out immensely . I would replace that omega torp with the 180 quantum launcher from the one soverign refit for 2500 zen . While you do take a minor dps loss initially from less damage upfront , you can broadside with that torpedo . This means that all 8 weapons will be able to fire on your target at once . Because you have a much wider arc with that torpedo , you can use it more , and because you are going to be broadsiding most of the time anyways ... you will be able to hit with that torpedo , resulting in a higher dps gain overall . With the cutting beam giving you more kinetic dps as well , this setup will help you immensely in ESTFs vs the borg , where kinetic damage is king . Also , with this setup , you wo n't need to have the highest turn rate because you have significant damage from all angles . Personally , I do n't like the omega torpedo myself , but if I have to use it , I would put it aft rather then fore in favor of the rapid fire plasma one . However , since you are n't running a plasma build , I would recommend that 180 arc quantum . * * Equipment :* * I would recommend the following for your engines / shield / deflector setup : Shields : The altered maco one ( KDF stats ) . This shield gives you enhanced survival with higher shield cap , and the one special stat on it is by far much better for survival then the maco one is . Engines : Again , the altered maco one ( KDF stats ) , for the simple reason that this gives you added power levels to your ship , and now gives you access to the 2pc KDF set bonus . Deflector : Maco Mk XII . The stats you get from this are far better then the borg one offers . * * Power Levels . * * You might as well run 100/50/25/25 simply because this will allow you to be at around 120 - 125 weapon power for maximizing your beam dps , and with all your shield skills , your power levels for shields will frequently be capped anyways . Cap the skill you wo n't be buffing as often . * * Doffs :* * Ok , I would make two doffs in particular a priority . 1 . Get the Doff that removes boarding parties PER PROC of Transfer shield strength . This is so useful it is n't even funny . Get this . 2 . There is a doff that just came out with the new packs that gives a hull HoT whenever you use aux to structural . Since Aux to structural 3 is one of your main hull heals , get this . Every little bit helps . * * Boff Config :* * All really good . Personally , I use FAW1 and APD1 , but getting 2 FAW skills would help you enhance your firepower quite a bit . Tac Team is less useful for 2 reasons . One , it clashes with Eng Team , and since you have 2 of them , you need to keep the CD free off those as much as possible . Reason number two is that the removal of boarding parties is satisfied with the TSS skill with that Doff I recommended earlier . If you feel like you need a bit more hull heals , drop the aux to dampeners for aux to structural Integrity 1 . The added heals , plus the added HoT that you get with the one Doff really helps out . All in all , really good . If you still feel you need more manuverability , drop one of the field generators / neutronium alloys for the saucer sep . It does increase what most people consider the weakest point of the ody , however with the broadsiding setup , you really do n't need to as much . Ohh , and lastly , do n't use the biofunction monitors ... crew is n't actually that useful . Sure the hull repairs slightly faster , but TBH , you have enough damage reduction , and hull heals that it pretty much makes that monitor worthless . Edit : For some reason , the format fucked up a bit . Hopefully it looks better . Ohh , and I would go with the science oddy . Added shields and aux increase pretty much all your skills much better then the tac version would ."", []]",t5_2uv5z,stobuilds,1357376968

When I flavor Force damage , I describe it as a physical impact , like someone swinging an invisible hammer . Thunder is either an incredibly deep ( think super dubstep bass ) rumble or painfully high pitched shriek . The shake from the rumble might be powerful enough to rattle a head within a helmet , jar and chip teeth , or even break bones . The shriek could be shrill enough to cause a migraine , or , again , break bones . Either way , the sound causing the thunder damage should be extremely loud . 2 ) It depends heavily on the nature of the attack . If a wizard is lobbing a fireball , then I 'll obviously describe the fire . But if say , a paladin in using some sort of holy strike with the radiant keyword , I might just flavor the glowing of his sword as opposed to some justification of the radiant damage type ( unless he 's fighting undead , in which case it becomes very important ) . Also , when narrating combat , try not to get too hung up on details . When I started DMing I 'd flavor each and every little twist and turn of weapon swing , every flash and ripple of a spell .

c7rljvz,t3_15x2vv,t3_15x2vv,3,"[""Here 's a guide to weapons . Tier One includes the SMG , Supressed SMG , Pump Shotgun , and Chrome Shotgun . The SMG and Supressed SMG are high rate of fire guns with lots of reserve ammunition . The supressed deals more damage but has more kick than the SMG . The shotguns are good for CQC , the Chrome shotgun has a tighter pellet spread , which could be good or bad depending on the situation ( large group vs. tank for example ) . Tier two includes the Combat Rifle , AK-47 , M16 , Tactical Shotgun , Combat Shotgun , Hunting Rifle and Sniper Rifle . The first three are assault rifles , the Combat Rifle is a 3 - round burst and is very accurate , it runs out of ammo rather quickly however . The M16 and AK-47 are essentially more powerful versions of the SMGs that fire slightly slower . Once again the AK-47 deals more damage but has less accuracy than the M16 . The Tactical Shotgun and Combat Shotgun are the automatic counterparts to the Pump and Chrome shotguns respectively . The Hunting and Sniper rifles are excellent weapons from a distance , especially against special infected . They are almost always a one - hit kill and they penetrate through many zombies , allowing for 4 or even 5 zombies to die from one bullet . The Sniper Rifle is specialized for sniping , with its more bullets and less kick from multiple shots . The Hunting Rifle , on the other hand , is a more versatile weapons , which can be used in pretty much any situation but is n't the best at anything , a jack - of - all - trades . As for your secondary weapons , there are dual pistols which are a quite versatile weapon , acting just like one pistol but with twice the clip size and fire rate and a slightly longer reload time . The Magnum is essentially a scopeless Hunting Rifle , great at any situation and a one - hit kill with great penetration , it 's greatest use however is if you 're incapped , you essentially become a turret that can cover your friends easily . There are also the multitude of melee weapons which essentially come in two varieties : short ones that swing fast and long ones that swing slower . The short ones are good for just killing a few zombies while the long ones are good for holding off a horde , as even the ones that are not killed instantly ( melees are one hit kills on everything except for Chargers , Witches , and Tanks ) will stumble significantly .

If they 're close to the EZ , or it 's just a small map , it can work . Generally , though , I find it counterproductive . For example , last night I had a match on Dagger crash in Wave 10 when the delivery was in the far corner . Guy # 1 gets there before me while Guy # 2 and Guy # 3 are hanging out near the EZ just killing things . Meanwhile , I rush over to help Guy # 1 , who has gone down .

Both of us bleed out before the other two guys get there ( because they were on the other end of the map ) . They start trading off revives as the enemies converge on them , refuse to use a missile to clear it out , and go down as well . Wave 10 crash on the second delivery ... yuck . All could have been avoided if everyone just went to the darn pizza in the first place . I see over and over again this logic of ' clearing ' zones of the map away from your teammates . It can be done , but I rarely see it executed in a helpful way . More often than not , you just spawn enemies closer to the people actually doing the objective , and you 're far away from them if they actually need your support .

c7sih82,t3_15wabs,t3_15wabs,3,"[""Heh , I think I 've played the game enough to be able to answer this with authority . Right off the bat , I 'd recommend you do n't try to mass gold if it 's your first or even third time playing through the game . Seriously . Being able to get enough gold to do literally anything is exciting at first , but it robs the game of a lot of mystery and excitement . It 's honestly more fun if you do n't power your way through the game , and let yourself struggle once in the while . Anyways , preaching aside , here we go . First , it goes without saying that you should steal everything that 's not nailed down in the Census Office . Get the quest to steal Fargoth 's gold , steal it , do n't turn the quest in , etc . Then go to Balmora . Join the Mages Guild , go downstairs and get the first quest from Ajira , the Khajit in the same room as the guild guide . She has you collecting mushrooms , and they all can easily be found in a few minutes of wandering around Seyda Neen . Go back to Balmora and turn the quest in . Her next quest is the money ticket . She has you planting a fake soulgem in the desk of Galbedir , who will be wandering downstairs on cue . Do so , but also take the privilege of taking all of the filled soulgems sitting on the desk . Head to Caldera via guild guide , sell her soulgems to the Creeper in Ghorak Manor . You might have to do some resting between sales to replenish his money , but you should be able net several thousand from this . Note that you can never use Galbedir 's enchanting or sell her soul gems after this , as she will think they 're the ones you stole from her , even if they 're different . At this point , you also need to get your hands on the Mark and Recall spell . Cast your Mark within speaking range of Creeper . Go to Ra'Virr 's shop in Balmora . I usually toss him a hundred or two gold bribe to raise his disposition . Buy one of his weapons that can cast Conjure Weapon . Go around Balmora and buy a set of armor in whichever armor class you favor . Next , you 'll need to use your remaining money to train your speechcraft , as well as your weapon / armor skills if necessary . When you 're all trained up , head to Vivec . Find an Ordinator . Taunt them in to attacking you , this is probably the trickiest part your first time through . Wait until they attack , conjure your weapon , and smoke them . If you struggle , join the Fighters Guild and go around to all their locations taking Restore Health potions from the guild chests . Take all of the Ordinator 's armor , Recall , and sell it to the Creeper . Again , you 'll have to wait to replenish his gold ( as well as buying things back when you 're selling the big stuff , so you do n't exceed his 5k limit ) . Use this money to round out your character 's Ordinator - killing skills , and you can repeat this process ad nauseam with no repercussions . Congratulations , you now have the ability to print money in Morrowind . * * TL;DR : I just laid out how to print money in Morrowind in great detail , with no real difficulty whatsoever .

c7sl90g,t3_163mkp,t3_163mkp,3,"['I would n\'t name Obama as the main force behind the recent gun control debate . One of the primary proposers of gun legislation currently is Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) . She \'s listed a proposal on her [ wesite ] ( URL_4 ) that outlines the following Bans the sale , transfer , importation , or manufacturing of : - 120 specifically - named firearms ; - Certain other semiautomatic rifles , handguns , shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one or more military characteristics ; and - Semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds . - Strengthens the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and various state bans by : - Moving from a 2 - characteristic test to a 1 - characteristic test ; - Eliminating the easy - to - remove bayonet mounts and flash suppressors from the characteristics test ; and - Banning firearms with “ thumbhole stocks ” and “ bullet buttons ” to address attempts to “ work around ” prior bans . - Bans large - capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds . Depending on how this legislation is worded it would outlaw a large number of firearms because there are many aftermarket magazines / components that allow for firearms to hold greater than 10 rounds . Also many modern handguns and what many would consider \' standard \' pistols come default with magazines that hold greater than 10 rounds . The characteristics tests are also a source of controversy because the characteristics are typically safety , cosmetic or ergonomic features that do not change the firing functionality of a firearm . Things like [ adjustable stocks ] ( URL_2 ) , [ barrel shrouds ] ( URL_0 ) , [ pistol grips ] ( URL_3 ) , and [ flash suppressors ] ( URL_1 ) Having one characteristic would quality a firearm as being an "" assault weapon "" and as such ban that particular weapon . Feinstein has also included provisions claiming to protect rights of hunters and existing owners . * Protects legitimate hunters and the rights of existing gun owners by :* - Grandfathering weapons legally possessed on the date of enactment ; - Exempting over 900 specifically - named weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes ; and - Exempting antique , manually - operated , and permanently disabled weapons . - Requires that grandfathered weapons be registered under the National Firearms Act , to include : - Background check of owner and any transferee ; - Type and serial number of the firearm ; - Positive identification , including photograph and fingerprint ; - Certification from local law enforcement of identity and that possession would not violate State or local law ; and - Dedicated funding for ATF to implement registration . "" Grandfathering "" means that any previously owned firearm would remain legal as long as it meets the necessary requirements . These requirements include registering each firearm as an NFA item . Currently there is a $ 200 tax stamp for each NFA item registered . Additionally Feinstein is proposing requiring each individual with an NFA item provide photos and the serial numbers of each qualifying firearm and allowing for the government to obtain a photograph and fingerprints . I do n\'t want to speculate on the outcome of this proposal but some have raised concerns that federal registration leads to confiscation based on the history of gun control in countries like the UK and Australia . Hope this explanation clears things up .', ['http://store.kriss-usa.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x800/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/b/a/barrel_shroud_type_2_m2_holes_std.jpg', 'http://vtsupply.com/images/FlashHider.jpg', 'http://www.brownells.com/userdocs/products/p_100008060_1.jpg', 'http://www.ifatactical.com/files/1772952/uploaded/Saw%20Pistol%20Grip.JPG', 'http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/assault-weapons']]",t5_2sokd,explainlikeimfive,1357568078
c7slu0d,t3_164759,t3_164759,17,"[""* * TEXT WALL INCOMING * * Seriously , one of the best things I have ever done is start volunteering , started off doing some Motorsport Marshalling at local events , simple stuff , normally just on gates making sure people who went in were meant to be there and then making sure nobody was doing anything stupid in the paddock ( Smoking for instance ) . At smaller events ( Go Karting and that ) I would get to learn the relevant flags used and get experience trackside marshalling . Some really interesting things happened there as well , considering on a race day only around 200 - 300 people would turn up , however on cup days we could get over 1000 combined in spectators and competitors and the racing would get more intense . It teaches you real life skill , I met a range of people I would n't normally meet and I learnt how to deal with certain situations which would be rare encounters in day to day life , but when they do happen , you 'd need a clear head . From there I got into much more advanced marshalling , I tended to specialise in Rally , but have done F1 ( At low level ) . It was through this that I met Ken Block and Lewis Hamilton , which is a bonus . Sadly , the two blokes who organised the team of marshalls I was involved with decided to get out of the business , One of the guys was nearing 65 and he really was n't up to standing around all day in the cold . From there , I wanted to do something a bit more hands on , something to actually help people , so I found out about a little scheme local to me called ' Street Angels ' , there 's a range of them across the UK , and most of them are backed and founded by churches or religious groups , however most do n't flaunt the religious aspect ( I 'm not religious in the slightest and do it just to help people ) but the role revolves around volunteering a friday or saturday evening / night ( 9.20PM - around 3/4am - ish dependent on when people decide to go home ) once a month to ' patrol ' the town highstreet in the nightclub sectors . We look to create and maintain a safe enviroment for night goers and assist the police so they can deal with the real troublemakers . A typical night will consist of around 3 - 4 teams of 2 - 4 people on a 2 teams in , 1 team out rota until about 2AM when all teams are out as clubs are kicking out . We will normally spend the first hour chatting with bouncers and clearing bottles that people have bought from home to drink on the way , but dump in a bush or street before they go into a club . As many will know you can very quickly turn a glass bottle into a murder weapon , so we dispose of these and get them away from the Night - Goers . We are also there to offer support , whether it be directions or something more , you really hear some stories from people and it makes you realise how lucky you are . In the midsection of the night is when things start to turn a bit more rowdy and fights break out , the ones that were to drunk to get into clubs and are refused entry tend to turn on the bouncers and other Night Goers . We are told to only get physical in self defence ( obviously ) and also as a last resort . I tend to not avoid the more violent encounters and choose to instead confont them . Sure some of these situations can turn scary , but stand your ground and most of these people , who are generally on their own change their tact when they realise they have no idea where they stand with you . So at this stage of the evening its the odd encounter with refused entries and mainly just keeping peace . However , this is also the part of the evening we 'll look for the homeless and that , as often some of the newly homeless guys end up bedding down in and around the town centre because they do n't know the hidey holes and get set upon when the night goers come out of the clubs and some dick decides he fancies a ' scrap ' . We 'll normally chat with them and show them some better places to stay or get them to a shelter ( If Eligible / has space ) . Then we have the post 2AM section , this is where shit kicks off . All the clubs kick out and the Police Paddy wagon comes to town . We 'll spend this part of the evening assisting the too drunk to the station / taxi rank , administering first aid , handing out flip flops to girls ( High Heels hurt apparently ) , clearing glass , dealing with fallout from fights ( Which is where we are most useful to the police ) , Gathering information post - incident ( Often people will tell us things in Confidence that they are uncomfortable telling the police directly , I.E. The drugs the person we have found collapsed in the club toilets has been seen taking ) . All in All we 're there to help , and try to do it in any way we can , each night is different to the next and it very quickly makes up for the lost sleep . I am also now hoping to make my next volunteering step in April by joining the Special Constabulary . TL;DR - Volunteer to a good cause ."", []]",t5_2qh1i,AskReddit,1357570983

c7t2ieu,t3_165qof,t3_165qof,6,"[""- I read through the comments and I do n't think one thing has been made clear enough . Although , for most states buying a firearm is really as simple as going to a store , being 18 or 21 and older , and passing a background check . There are a few states where procuring a weapon ( legally ) is a lot more difficult . States with large populations and large urban populations tend to have stricter gun regulations . States like Illinois , California , New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Maryland , Pennsylvania , and a few others are stricter . These states typically require a separate background check and possible waiting time between when the purchase is made and when the firearm is received . For example , in my state , Illinois everyone seeking to purchase a firearm must hold a FOID ( Firearm Owners Identification ) card . This involves a separate background check run by the state in order to obtain one . Buyers are also required to wait a 3 day period between when I buy the firearm and when I am legally allowed to take it home . In almost all states , however , private gun sales ( a non - weapon dealer selling to another ) are not regulated . This means that someone can circumvent most gun control laws provided that they purchase a firearm from a private seller . In certain neighborhoods of Chicago ( and many other metropolitan locations ) , buying an illegal firearm is probably just as easy as buying a legal one . - Most states do not require any special laws requiring people to lock their weapons . There are a few exceptions where parents are required to restrict access to firearms if children are present , but gun safety is predominantly the responsibility of the owner . - In the US there are a few types of firearms that are regulated more then others . These include short barreled rifles and shotguns ( pretty self explanatory ) , destructive devices ( things that fire rockets and missiles ) , suppressors , and fully automatic firearms . I do n't think that short barreled rifles or shotguns should be regulated . I do n't think that suppressors should be regulated either . However , I 'm a bit torn on fully automatic firearms and destructive devices . There is a part of me that screams that full automatics and DDs should be legal since it 's a right , but then there is a part of me that thinks that maybe your average person should n't own these . - No ! There are plenty of people who should not have access to a firearm . Some people are not mature or responsible enough to be trusted with a firearm . That said , I think everyone with the exception of violent criminals and people who have been shown to be mentally deficient should have the right to own firearms ."", []]",t5_2vtr4,progun,1357623154

Not blessed with good looks and not cursed with bad . When I was younger I was not popular . in fact it was pretty much the opposite . I liked things that were different and I was kind of a loner . I did not know how to look people in the eye and I talked down to people because I thought I was smart . I was emotional and it was easy to make me cry . Trust me , it is no fun when people find out that they can make you cry at 14 years old . As I got older I decided that I did not want to be me anymore . I wanted to be liked . I knew there were those people that just had good looks and people liked them . I was never going to be one of those people . But , there were also people that did n\'t look special , but had friends and even managed to pull the pretty girls once in a while .

I have a good job that depends heavily on relationships and being liked by people . I am happy ( I was miserable as a teenager ) . And I have a very positive outlook on life .

Look in the mirror . Practice . When you smile what do you see ? Remember , it is what others see that matters , so change your smile if you need to . Try showing teeth , try not showing teeth , try to show that smile in your eyes . When you learn how to best project the smile that fits your face , your life will be better . Now , concentrate on smiling ( not all the time silly , that is kind of creepy too , but probably quite a bit more than you are used to ) . Which brings me to # 2 . 2 . ) Look people in the eyes . Do n\'t stare into their eyes , that can be creepy too , but when you meet someone or start talking to someone make eye contact . This exudes confidence and people are attracted to confident people . 3 . ) Learn to manage body language . Shake your head / nod your head when they are talking . Pay attention to what you do with your hands . Find a comfortable go to position . I personally hold my right wrist with my left hand or hold them straight at my sides when I do not know what else to do with my hands . Crossing your arms makes you seem closed and uninterested . Waving your arms around too much makes you seem a erratic . Practice and find what works best for you . 4 . ) Stand up straight . Remember the confidence thing . Good posture also helps project confidence . 5 . ) Voice inflection / pace . Practice it . Watch movies with people you find charismatic and watch how they change their pace and tone based on what they are trying to say . 6 . ) Control your emotions ( This can be very hard ) . Do n\'t get angry easily . When people see that they are making you angry / scared it can feed them and it makes some people feel empowered . 7 . ) Do n\'t lie / Don\'t boast too much . People will catch you and it will come back to haunt you . 8 . ) Learn how to make small talk . Ask people about themselves . Learn about sports / travel / science , things that are interesting to the people you want to be around . 9 . ) Clean your clothes and have good personal Hygiene . 10 . ) Have some style . I have no style sense . My wife says I am attracted to plaid like a moth is to light . So I ask . JoS A. Banks tells me what I need to wear for work and my wife(or Penney\'s / Macy \'s ) tells me what I need to wear for casual . I literally say "" I want to look professional . Help me . "" or "" I need to look business casual . Help me . "" They do . And if you watch for their sales they are pretty reasonable . Heck even the girls at Penney \'s are pretty good . I know that my taste does not impress others , so I ask . 11 . ) Follow up . If you say you are going to do something , do it . It will do wonders for business type relationships . 12 . ) Treat others with respect . People watch how you treat other people and they will judge you for it . I know that this is a bit of an overwhelming list . It has taken me years and I still struggle sometimes .

c7tvz2z,t3_166upe,t3_166upe,3,"['* * 1 . Atlanta Braves * * To have a shutdown bullpen , you have to have a dominant closer , and the Braves \' Craig Kimbrel is coming off one of the greatest seasons ever for a reliever : Opposing hitters had 231 plate appearances against him , and he struck out 116 -- almost exactly half -- in 62 2/3 innings , with just 14 walks and 27 hits . When he threw strike one on the first pitch of the at - bat ( 147 of those 231 plate appearances ) , hitters went 16 - for-143 , with 97 strikeouts and one extra - base hit . Here \'s one more : After hitters got ahead in the count , they went 5 - for-32 , with 10 strikeouts . Just one more : With two outs and runners in scoring position , opposing hitters were 1 - for-18 with 10 strikeouts . In other words , Kimbrel is the best closer in the game , and , at the outset of his career , he has established an unprecedented trajectory : Nobody has been this good so soon . The Braves have outstanding relievers stacked all around Kimbrel , from underrated Eric O\'Flaherty ( 1.73 ERA in 64 appearances last season ) to Jonny Venters ( who seemed to bounce back in a big way after a rough first half ) to Cristhian Martinez ( 65 strikeouts in 73 2/3 innings ) to Luis Avilan . And , oh by the way , the Braves swapped for hard - throwing Jordan Walden ( average fastball velocity last year : 96.3 mph ) in the offseason , with some confidence they can help his command , and , if that happens , Atlanta could essentially end games after the fifth and sixth innings . This is an extraordinary bullpen , and the Braves \' staff and front office deserve credit for changing the way the Atlanta relievers were rested in 2012 after the relievers were worn out in 2011 . Some teams do n\'t change ; the Braves did . * * 2 . Tampa Bay Rays * * The names change almost every year , but the performance remains the same . Tampa Bay led the American League in bullpen ERA , after Fernando Rodney became the Rays \' latest reclamation project ( watching the Tampa Bay bullpen every year is like watching an episode of "" American Restoration , "" on which junk is turned into gleaming excellence ) , and he merely became a Cy Young candidate , with just 43 hits and two homers allowed in 74 2/3 innings . He is surrounded by Jake McGee and Joel Peralta and perhaps Roberto Hernandez -- the pitcher formerly known as Fausto Carmona -- who has always had great stuff but an inconsistent delivery . It would surprise no one in the sport if we checked back in August and found that Hernandez had become a dominant setup man . Such is the reputation of the Rays for identifying bullpen talent , and the reputation of pitching coach Jim Hickey for refining that talent . * * 3 . Kansas City Royals * * In a September conversation , some of the Chicago White Sox hitters and staff talked about the Royals \' bullpen with complete awe and respect . No team , Adam Dunn said , had a collection of power arms like that of the Royals . "" It \'s like every guy comes out of the bullpen throwing 97 [ mph ] "" Dunn said . The bullpen might be the best piece of hope for Royals fans to hang on to because if the Kansas City rotation can be at least mediocre -- just average -- the Royals \' bullpen would win a lot of games in the late innings . Aaron Crow had 65 punchouts in 64 2/3 innings ; Tim Collins whiffed 93 in 69 2/3 innings ; closer Greg Holland had 91 strikeouts in 67 innings . The Royals \' bullpen racked up 535 strikeouts in 561 1/3 innings and finished sixth in the majors in ERA , at 3.17 . * * 4 . Baltimore Orioles * * The Orioles had a makeshift rotation all season , because of injuries and performance , yet the Baltimore bullpen held up despite an extraordinary workload . No team that made the playoffs needed more bullpen innings than the Orioles , yet the Baltimore relievers finished fifth in ERA at 3.00 , a tribute to the way Buck Showalter and his coaches use all parts of their pitching staff . Closer Jim Johnson had a major - league - best 51 saves , with just 15 walks in 68 2/3 innings , and got a whole lot of help from Pedro Strop , Darren O\'Day and Luis Ayala . One of the interesting decisions the Orioles will face in spring training will be what to do with left - hander Brian Matusz , who has generally struggled as a starter -- but had moments of total dominance out of the bullpen down the stretch . It might be that Matusz is a modern version of Arthur Rhodes and is just more comfortable pitching out of the bullpen ; he told me during the playoffs that he really loved throwing in relief . * * 5 . San Francisco Giants * * Arizona GM Kevin Towers is known for being one of the best at piecing together a bullpen , so it should be no surprise that his former manager in San Diego , Bruce Bochy , is known for being among the best handlers of a relief corps . The past four seasons , this is how the San Francisco bullpen has ranked in the majors in ERA : 2009 2nd ( 3.49 ) 2010 2nd ( 2.99 ) 2011 2nd ( 3.04 ) 2012 15th ( 3.56 ) Sergio Romo took over from Brian Wilson as closer last season , seamlessly -- especially in the postseason . In the playoffs and World Series , the Giants \' bullpen , bolstered by a temporary relief assignment for Tim Lincecum , was difference - making . Jeremy Affeldt did n\'t allow a run in 10 1/3 innings and struck out 10 . The Giants \' bullpen has nice righty / lefty balance , swing - and - miss capability and experience .

Its a somewhat long idea and I 'm sure there are holes in it , but I would love to hear what people think of it . * Repeal the 1986 firearms act . Place the 1994 Assault weapons ban back in place , but only make possession and sales illegal , and create an exemption for people assigned what I like to call a FWOL ( Federal Weapon Operator License ) Its just a name . It can be anything really . Transfer of automatic weapons to people without a FOWL will also be illegal . * A FOWL is a shall - issue arms lisence that exempts people from the assault weapons ban . It allows people to puchase any small arm automatic , m249 , single shot , semi automatic , whatever . * A FOWL also acts as a CCW License for any state . * In order to get a FOWL you have to provide finger prints , a picture , a background check ( NOT a NICS check , an actual Background check ) and all that . They will also have to show that they have the same marksmanship abilities and safety training same standards that the local police have . ( I honestly do think this is a very high bar , but I would like some feedback on this ) . * The point is that these individuals who have a FOWL are trusted . This lisence will be renewed every 3 or 4 years , but when they puchase a firearm they wo n't have to do a NICS check , all they will have to do is show their FOWL and pay for their weapon . * A FOWL will be treated the same way as a car license and may be revoked by a court if the user is shown to be unsafe . A police officer may also ask you to present a FOWL if you are in posession of an assault weapon . My idea with this legislation is that it makes people happy on all sides . Only trusted individuals are able to puchase and possess automatic assault weapons ( Gun Grabbers want this ) . The weapons themselves are not tracked . We have a solution for the issue of wondering if your CCW is ok in another state .

Even if it \'s just new NPC dialogue , it \'d be cool to be running around after every patch knowing they could have dropped new hints to an ongoing storyline . I like the idea of monthly content updates , but would also like to see them take advantage of their ability to drop new DEs and content in seamlessly and see it happen a little more frequently . 2 ) Kind of goes hand - in - hand with no . 1 , but more emphasis on the open world . Dungeons are cool and all , and they definitely need love , but in my opinion they need to take a step back from going in the direction most other MMOs do ( open world is "" leveling content "" or preparatory for instanced content , which is the ultimate mode for character progression ) . 3 ) Gem shop overhaul . There \'s not much in it that \'s really exciting , and so far they \'ve released new items into it veeeerrrry sloooowly , mostly in conjunction with themed updates . There are regular town clothes skins NPCs wear that players have been wanting since before launch that show no sign of making it into the game for us to use any time soon . Meanwhile , people are questioning why we ca n\'t just wear town clothes in combat since we \'re getting all these cool flashy costume pieces ( like the witch outfit , Mad King costume , ect . ) , which cost more than armor skins . Also , some more armor and weapon skins in the shop would be nice ( still hoping for glasses I can wear in combat ) . More character customization options -- hairstyles , tattoos , faces , so on -- would be great too . 4 ) A change to how transmutation works . The popular suggestion for a skin locker is pretty freaking awesome , and we could still be required to use t - stones to transfer the skins to armor pieces . I \'d also like to see the addition of a third type of stone or something that would allow transmutation of looks only between armor types . The only concern I can see with that is artistic , and frankly it \'s already possible to make really hideous combinations within a single armor weight . 5 ) New weapons for each profession and new utility / elite skills , preferably requiring some effort to unlock . 6 ) A more interesting method of distributing unique weapon skins than "" dump your extra rares in the Mystic Forge . "" World bosses and events with chances for specific drops , ect . 7 ) The cleansing of Orr . 8) The option to remove that annoying black border around the screen . It \'s just big enough to be irritating , and the game looks * so * much better without it . 9 ) Tentatively ( dependent on how they chose to implement them ): mounts and heroes / henchmen . I \'ve always really liked mounts , and would be perfectly happy with one that only gave a 25 - 33 % speed boost without needing to use a utility slot .

The upgrade pistols for the other factions are not the Rebel though . Especially not the TR one , I hear . - I trialed the SAS - R and Impetus at launch , and somehow ended up buying the impetus .

c7ufy7c,t3_16b892,t3_16b892,8,"['This probably wo n\'t win me many friends in this subreddit , but I \'ll say it anyways . There are a lot of paranoid , scary people in the U.S. who hoard guns and have this "" Me vs. the world "" mentality . They seem to think that by hoarding food , weapons , and ammunition , they \'ll be able to survive whatever post - apocalyptic scenario they are most afraid of . As far as I am concerned , many preppers are doing the exact opposite of what they should be doing ; they \'re making themselves targets . Rather than developing useful skills , like hunting , first aid , or blacksmithing ( something that would be incredibly valuable in a societal collapse ) they surround themselves with guns and canned goods thinking they would somehow be immune . When everybody is starving , except you , people will take notice . Alas , too many people have no idea what a siege situation would really be like , being stuck in a house , surrounded by enemies , your supplies dwindling by the day . And that \'s if your enemies do n\'t try to burn you out , or just shoot your house up , so on and so forth . No place is impenetrable , no one man is an army . I am absolutely , 100 % for the 2nd amendment ; however , I only own a shotgun , because what good is a gun without bullets ? A much more effective defensive weapon is a crossbow or recurve bow ; fletching is another useful skill that would pay you back in spades if SHTF . It is quiet , ammo is essentially unlimited , and it is easy to carry in a bug - out scenario . If you have to get out of Dodge , but you \'re weighed down by a dozen rifles and thousands of rounds of ammo , you wo n\'t make it very far ! So , in my opinion , guns would be useful in the short term , but long term , you \'re leaving yourself exposed . Personally , I \'d rather bug out than face a siege situation , and try to live off of the land than fight my fellow man . Food stores run out , ammo gets exhausted , and unless you \'ve got an army at your back , eventually you WILL be overwhelmed , tricked , or simply besieged . Would people come knocking , trying to take your stuff ? Yup , probably . Would you be able to defend it ? Unless you live in a castle and have several years of food stores saved up , probably not . But that is the U.S. gun culture ; too many people think the government is going for a complete takeover , or there is going to be a deadly flu epidemic , so on and so forth .

A crazy guy with 100 guns and 100k rounds of ammo , with a cabin in the woods and 5 years of supplies is a lot more compelling than someone like me , who does their own canning , owns but one weapon , and is developing useful ( but not exactly exciting ) skills .

c7ugnul,t3_16apto,t1_c7uaxjw,8,"['The reason many pro - gun people react this way is because if they give an inch then gun control advocates take a mile . Many gun control advocates really do want to ban all guns . However , the Second Amendment does n\'t allow them to do that . Instead , they just regulate it to death until guns become extremely difficult to come by . There is talk going around about another possible federal assault weapons ban . The actual bill has n\'t been drafted yet as far as I know , but Senator Feinstein will be the one introducing it if it happens . She has introduced many similar bills in the past , including the successfully passed 1994 AWB . She and some of her supporters have publicly stated some of the things they would like to have in the bill . Some of those things include but are not limited to : - Re - branding a large variety of guns as "" assault weapons . "" It \'s a convoluted set of criteria that determines if something is or is n\'t an assault weapon and I do n\'t really want to get into it , but estimates are that 75 % of all handguns and 50 % of all long guns would be reclassified as assault weapons under this new set of criteria . - Amending the National Firearms Act of 1934 ( NFA ) to include these new assault weapons . That would mean that for ever one of these guns that a person owns , he will have to register his name , address , gun \'s serial number , etc . with the government and pay a $ 200 tax per gun . Failure on the part of the gun owner to do this is a federal felony . - Amending the NFA so that any and all NFA items become illegal to buy , sell , or transfer even upon death of the owner . In other words , once you have them , you are stuck with them . Even if you die , your heirs may not inherit them . The government has your name and address and guns \' serial numbers on file , so they know where to find it . Once the owner dies , the only legal option is to return the gun(s ) to the government for destruction . This is a slow form of gun confiscation that , in just one generation , would cause 75 % of all handguns and 50 % of all long guns to be confiscated . I \'m sure that you can imagine why gun owners might object to these new rules . Now the bill that Senator Feinstein actually proposes might not have all of these things because not all of them have widespread support among Congress . However , she has publicly stated that she wants these things . Any additional regulations that she proposes will be steps in that direction , but she wo n\'t be fully satisfied until at least these things happen , if not an all - out ban . Even if these things pass , she will introduce more legislation right after the next mass shooting . Keeping that in mind , why should gun owners allow any anti - gun legislation to pass ? Also , if what I said is true ( I can look up sources if need be or you can research on your own ) , then is it entirely inaccurate to say that the government is coming for all , or at least most , of our rights ? * * Edit :* * I was just shown [ this video ] ( URL_0 ) of Sen.

Tent - you're in Florida so you want bug protection to stay sane . Shared tent lightens the load and cost . Go for total heads + 1 for room on tent size . Sleeping bag or quilt - you do n't need much and can go with something cheaper here to save bucks . You can use a summer weight bag ( 45 degrees ) . Down cost more but packs smaller . Brand is not very important for beginners as long as it 's not a WalMart sleepover type bag . Kelty Light Year bags can be found for fairly cheap if you need a brand to look for . Backpacking stove - newbies are bet off with a butane canister type stove like the venerable MSR Pocket Rocket . Easy to use and light . You do n't need liquid fuel for FL . Cookset - a single 2 quart alminum pot will do it and can be cheap . If you want to splurge a MSR pot set with the nesting 1.5/2L pots would be great . Sleeping pad - yes you need this . For beginners the cheap WalMart blue foam pad will do the trick . Better pads would be the Big Agnes air pads , or a Thermarest foamie . Rain gear - yes definitely . It should be breathable material , not just a vinyl hardshell . Clothing - at least one pair of zipoff hiking pants , a couple of wicking t - shirts , 2~3 pairs of hiking socks , a long sleeve shirt or fleece for the evening . You can sleep in running shorts and a t - shirt . Try to stay away from cotton , denim is a horrible choice for backpacking . Bring a brimmed hat and sunglasses too . Food - I always build up a menu from items bought at the grocery and do n't use dehydrated backpacking food . Rice , pastas , pouch tuna and chicken , couscous , dehydrated beans , cheese , salami , tortilla wraps , dehydrated fruits and vegetables , nuts , bulk granola , and so forth . Safety gear - compass , maps , a real GPS ( not your cell phone ) , a PLB if appropriate , and a written plan left behind with someone trustworthy . Do not rely upon your cell phone to save your ass , assume that it WILL NOT WORK . First aid kit - build it up yourself is what I would suggest . Most store bought kits are nice to look at but that 's it . I pack motrin , aspirin , bandages , 4x4 's , roller gauze , a sam splint , benadryl , sunscreen , etc . Water treatment - for a beginner you should go with tablets such as Micropur . I use a Steripen ( UV light gadget ) but always pack Micropur tablets anyway . There are literally books on how to treat water , but the safe thing is to assume that any water you use needs treatment of some kind . Places to buy - REI is the best overall especially for beginners . Online there 's Campmor which has good deals if you know what to look for . EMS is another good source . Really , there 's too many to list . By no means is anything I 've said here is complete - there are plenty of other options available that I have n't mentioned ."", []]",t5_2qqom,CampingandHiking,1357844173

I actually get along great with my stepdad and have never had any problems with him , unlike most kids my age had at the time . Every day after school , at around 3:30pm , my mom would call and ask how my day was . She did this so I would n\'t feel so distant from her , only getting to see her every other weekend . One day , I sat at the phone eagerly awaiting my mom \'s call , I believe because I just got my report card and was pleasantly surprised with my marks . 3:30pm came around , but no call . I knew not to call her myself , because I never wanted to interrupt her at work ( she is the Vice - President of an IT company owned by her husband ) . At around 4:30pm , the phone rang . I quickly rushed to the phone , knowing it was her . After saying "" Hi mom ! "" there was no answer , only the faint sound of a few people talking in the background . I repeated myself . Still no answer , just people talking . Too faint to understand what they were saying . All of a sudden I hear what sounds like a young woman crying . I immediately assumed it was my mom . I start yelling over the phone , trying to grab her attention . Still no answer . The crying turns into a banshee - like wail . The people in the background start yelling .

Oh god , please help her ! "" "" She \'s not breathing ! "" The voices quiet down , only for a few seconds , while I hear what sounds like my stepdad counting out loud .

Yes this class is considered Melee due to having to use Rocket Punch at 5 meters and Flame Burst at 10 meters so they are always close to the target . Most raid groups would love one in their ranks instead of the usual two marauders . They bring the ability to taunt if needed ( firebrand and stormcaller fight ) and have a harpoon pull that is extreemly usefull ( kephess fight for bombardiers ) . Snipers are the basic end all be all for ranged class . High output of DPS and not too hard to use at lvl 50 . They have excellent AOE damage output due to Orbital Strike/ Corrosive grenade can hit multiple targets . Their entire rotation : Corrosive Dart , Corrosive Grenade , Weakening Blast , Cull , Series of Shots , Ambush , Cull , Rifle Shot , REPEAT . Snipers also have a LOT of defensive cooldowns . Sheild Probe puts a sheild that lasts 20 ( ? ) seconds and mitigates a decent amount of damage over that time period and has a relatively short cooldown ( 30 seconds , 20 if you are specced into it ) . They also have Evasion that makes them able to completely dodge most abilities for 3 seconds ( great if they accidentally take boss aggro ) . And the best for last Ballistic Sheild . This puts a MASSIVE shield out that anyone within 15 ( ? ) meters can walk into that reduces all damage done to all friendlies under the bubble by 20 % for 15 ( ? ) seconds . This helps a TON in boss fights that put out a lot of AOE raid damage . They definitely do nt have the bursty dps that a Powertech does due to having to DOT up their targets first ( corrosive dart , corrosive grenade , weakening blast , THEN * * CULLLLL * * deals a ton of damage ) so 4 global cooldowns and then the channel of Cull in order to start actually bursting a target . Powertechs can just burst a target when they see fit with rocket punch + railshot ( procced ) . They have two DOTs that they must maintain on the target from Flame Burst and Incendiary Missile at all times in order to really do a ton of damage though . Luckily Flame Bursts DOT is refreshed every time Rail Shot hits the target ( the DOT from Flame Burst only lasts a couple of seconds and needs to be refreshed frequently and watched very closely to make sure its always on . ) Powertechs have great AOE damage as well from their Death from Above ability . This does the equivalent of the Snipers ' Orbital strike damage but in a much shorter and immediate way . The Snipers ' OS channels for a few seconds , then takes a few seconds to start up , then hits 3 times on the target for massive damage . Basically a full 10 - 12 seconds to actually deal its full damage . The Powertechs DFA deals all this damage immediately over 3 - 4 seconds with no initial channel time . Powertechs have one defensive cooldown , a personal sheild that mitigates all damage by 20 % for 20 seconds . Good for when bosses do raid wide AOE damage phases but this shield has a long cooldown . Bursty DPS is kind of important due to a few of the boss fights really benefiting from having someone who can burst a target . These fights include Kephess , Operator , Kephess the Undying , The Terror from Beyond ( really helpful here ) . So to sum up each : SNIPER : Ranged class ( always loved ) , high DPS , relatively easy rotation , low burst damage ( has to DOT up target first ) , excellent AOE damage , lots of Defensive Cooldowns . POWERTECH : Melee class , high DPS , high burst damage , mildly complicated rotation , lots of utility in raids ( taunts , harpoon pull ) , great AOE damage . well this post has been kind of randomly put together . hopefully i got my point across ."", []]",t5_2qxih,swtor,1357911442

What would your next step be ? Ban all things that can be fashioned into a weapon ?

Gun control is a nothing more than putting a band - aid on an amputation wound . Now for the clowns out there saying we should be giving everyone more guns that 's fucking nuts too .

Last I checked the gangsters shooting each other over drug territory was n't discussed at all recently and they account for most of the gun violence .

Next they need to break the whole shooting someone is ok mentality . Growing up in Boston and hanging out with people that have carried illegally I 've seen them go on and on about how they would kill anyone for offending them , that is not ok behavior those people need counseling . Next go after the mass shootings . How should we reduce those . My first response would be mental health initiatives but that 's only going to help a little . This is going to sound crazy but regulate the media a little bit . I know I know freedom of press blah blah blah . Let them report the incidents but do n't let them post pictures of the victims , do n't let them put up pictures of the suspects , make them wait until trial is over to release any information on victims and suspects . People wo n't want to stare at 14 hours of coverage on a shooting with blurred out faces . Call it an incident privacy law , it 's been discussed many times that the media help facilitate new shootings by turning the gunman into an anti - hero and it 's pretty obvious that they do . Guns are a touchy subject in America and we ca n't compare ourselves to other countries . When Australia banned firearms they only had to collect 600k guns we have an estimated 300 million guns in the homes of Americans . If you look at other countries other crimes rose after removing guns so what crimes will rise in America . I bet it would be robberies , home invasions and rape but that just seems to be the crimes that would be most deterred by gun carrying citizens . If everyone would stop arguing over what they think will work and have a middle ground we can help stop this crazy shit from happening again . I own four guns and have my concealed weapons permit .

Prohibitions only succeed when people follow them . Consider the alcohol prohibition . It failed miserably as people wanting alcohol were able to get it . Speakeasies sprung up to server those looking to buy a couple of drinks while having a night on the town . Bootleggers distilled liquors and people made bathtub gin in their homes . Eventually the alcohol prohibition was repealed . The current prohibition against cannabis has proven to be a complete failure . Once again we have a state prohibition that is rendered entirely ineffective by the existence of a black market . Anybody who wants to get cannabis generally can and the number of people imprisoned versus the number of people growing , selling , and using cannabis is likely very low . Now Colorado and Washington have declare the use of cannabis in their states legal . This is likely the beginning of the end for cannabis prohibition . The same tactic may work regarding firearms as well . Prohibiting a device that can be manufactured in any home is impossible . Things will be even more difficult for the state if they do n\'t attempt to seize currently possessed magazines and firearms . Since magazines are n\'t serial numbered there is no way to prove when they were manufactured . Likewise firearms constructed for personal use do n\'t have to be serial numbered unless you plan to transfer them ... legally . If people are able to get whatever prohibited item they want then the prohibition is meaningless . I think the obsession with remaining lawful is often a hindrance to gun rights activist .

c7vlk6o,t3_16fn3x,t3_16fn3x,4,"[""First , I 'd make sure that the enemies are legitimately scary gameplay wise . Games like Dead space critically misunderstand horror and thriller in games . Each enemy should be a challenge in itself , something that makes the player honestly think if staying and fighting is the better option . But it should n't be because they 're merely invincible . To me that would limit the gameplay choices too much for me . I 'd do this through primarily making enemies far tougher than you , both in terms of raw strength and hitpoints . This way you get the genuine feeling that your in under your head . To me , it 's incredibly scary to face anything down knowing full well that the odds are stacked against you . I 'd also make the enemies with a smart AI . An dumb enemy is n't scary at all . If I can outsmart an enemy by just simply hiding under a table for a few moments , it 's not scary . The overlying theme I 'd want with my enemies would be that they 're genuinely better than you . You will not be finding the enemies easy . Second , I 'd make the player very relatable . The protagonist is an everyman , imagine a Sales assistant fighting smart zombies . This way the player would be more scared by association . A player is n't going to be scared playing as an Ex - Military character who can wield every weapon known to man with pin - point accuracy , and is capable of taking multiple bullets before getting a scratch . They do n't need to be scared because they know that they 're a fucking tank . No , the character would have to be relatable and weak . Third , the protagonists enemies would constantly change , to induce paranoia slowly . Imagine if in a game , you were constantly being betrayed , or you 'd realise a fact that points to your actions having actually been wrong all this time . It would obviously having to be done carefully , so as to not simply have everyone realise that their new ally will betray them later . But constantly shifting allegiances would help to create an aura of paranoia surrounding the character . This is pretty simple to do ( In theory ) . You start out with Ally A. Eventually , Ally A betrays you , attempting to kill you for a perceived allegiance with another character .. You soldier on , eventually finding Ally B , an old arch nemesis of Ally A , and the person Ally A believed you were helping . Soon , you meet and befriend Ally C. Gradually , you being to distrust Ally B. He seems just a little bit too violent , killing where he could have punished , and you see evidence of him lying to you multiple times . So , you leave Ally B , and in doing so , unwittingly end up working together again with Ally A , still working with Ally C on the side . Again , obviously better written than this , since writing is not my forte , but you get the point . Similarly , I 'd use enemy placement to confuse and increase paranoia in the player . An obvious enemy encampment , suddenly has no enemies , a safe spot is actually crawling with enemies . Combined with an idea like your , OP ( Not knowing if an enemy is actually an enemy ) , and switching allegiances , I 'd love to think of a player walking into every new area afraid that they 'll soon die . Finally ( At least for now , I 'm starting to get tired ): I 'd instigate Permadeath if feasible . Suddenly death is fucking scary , because you 've just put ten hours into this character , and you do n't want to die because you made a stupid mistake or were n't strong enough to kill your enemy . * * tl;dr Tough Enemies , Weak players , make it difficult to truly know who your real allies are , Induce Paranoia , both story wise and gameplay wise , and have permadeath . * *"", []]",t5_2qhwp,Games,1358000975

You have five cable types ( technically more but these are the ones you \'ll potentially use ): * * ULC ( ultra low current / tin cable ): * * This cable works just like the glass fiber cable in that it can carry power for 40 blocks before losing any EU , and it \'s much cheaper . The drawback is it \'ll explode if you send more than 5 EU / t packets through it . This means : use this cable every time you want to transfer energy from ( first tier ) solar panels , water mills , or wind mills to a storage device . * * Insulated Copper Cable :* * This cable will explode if you give it more than 32 EU / t packets , which puts it in the LV ( low voltage ) category . It is quite lossy , so never run it longer than 4 blocks before going back into a batbox , or you \'ll lose energy . Early on in FTB when you \'re on a budget and only dealing with LV , use bat box - > 4 insulated copper cable - > bat box - > copper cable , etc . to transfer your energy to machines . BdoubleO \'s cable exploded because he was sending 128 EU / t packets ( medium voltage ) through this cable that can only support 32 EU / t packets . The MFE outputs 128 EU / t. * * 2x Insulated Gold Cable :* * This is your medium voltage cable , capable of handling 128 EU / t packets . Any more and it \'ll explode . The problem ? You ca n\'t run it longer than 3 blocks without losing power . This is the point in FTB where you \'re getting penalized for being cheap . It \'s fine for connecting MFEs together or even attaching a machine less than 4 blocks away . However , to avoid energy loss we need to upgrade our cabling . * * Glass Fibre Cable :* * This is essentially "" all - purpose cabling "" due to its great energy retention . It \'s a little expensive ( 1 diamond , 2 silver , 6 glass per 6 blocks of cable ) , but it can handle up to 512 EU / t packets ( high voltage ) * and * only loses 1 EU / t every 40 blocks . Unless you \'re transferring ultra low voltage ( 5 EU / t or under ) , you \'ll want to use glass fibre cabling . Since BdoubleO is connecting his industrial electrolyzer further than 3 blocks away from the MFE , and he needs MV , this is the cabling he needs to use from the MFE to the electrolyzer . Hell , he does n\'t even need to make any . Just replace the glass fibre cable going from the batbox to the MFE with insulated copper cabling , and then use that glass fibre cabling to go from the MFE to the electrolyzer . * * 4x Insulated HV Cable :* * This cable has a weird name . The glass fibre cable is technically your high voltage cable , this thing is an extreme voltage cable , able to handle 2048 EU / t. These things start to lose energy after just one block , so there \'s only two instances to ever use these : * You need to . This is a rare circumstance , and only comes about when you \'re using lightning rods and I think the fusion reactor . * The uninsulated HV cable is a great weapon . One electric shock will most likely kill you . * * TL;DR :* * If you \'re transferring power from a basic solar panel , water mill , or wind mill , use ultra low current ( tin ) cable . If you \'re transferring up to 32 EU / t a short distance , use insulated copper cable ( but do n\'t run it longer than 4 blocks before connecting to a machine or batbox ) . For everything else , use glass fibre cable . You may need to use a couple HV cables later with other energy setups like the lightning rod , but do n\'t concern yourself with it otherwise . Note : I probably typed glass fiber cable sometimes and glass fibre cable other times . It \'s the same thing . In - game it \'s called glass fibre cable . I assume this is a British spelling .

c7vvu5w,t3_16fy2f,t1_c7vrpnz,17,"['If you ask me Feinstein \'s bill will get someone killed if enacted in it \'s current form . The Grandfather portion of the bill appears not to be an attempt to grandfather the 120 models listed as banned guns but already owned by citizens . It \'s a way of tricking owners into contacting the ATF and outing themselves . Feinstein \'s bill reclassifies banned guns already owned as falling under NFA ( National Firearms Act ) law . In a nutshell it classifies them the same a machine guns . NFA law is extremely strict regarding transfer of ownership , possession and registration of NFA guns . Before an NFA gun can be legally obtained it must first already have been registered with the ATF . Registration of NFA firearms can only be done by the Manufacturers and importers . The intent is obvious and makes sense , they want to track and control automatic weapons as soon as they are made or brought into the country . It is a federal felony for any normal citizen who does not possess the correct licensing and tax stamp provided by the ATF to possess a registered NFA firearm . So step one for someone interested owning an NFA gun is to jump through a bunch of paperwork , applications , background checks by the ATF just to get authorized . Then once authorized you have to apply for approval from the ATF to purchase a specific already registered NFA gun . The gun must be named by serial number on the transferee of ownership application . It \'s a separate felony to possess an NFA weapon that is not registered with the ATF . If Feinstein \'s Bill becomes law , at that moment millions of gun owners will become instantly guilty of 2 federal felonies . 1 . Being in possession of an NFA weapon without the correct FFL ( federal firearms license ) or tax stamp , punishment is 10 years in prison and up to a 250,000 fine . 2 . Being in possession of an unregistered NFA weapon since non of these weapons were ever registered at the time of manufacturer by maker with the ATF . After all they were not NFA when they were made . She is saying all they need to do is contact the ATF and pay the tax stamp and register the guns . It \'s a federal felony for them to be in possession of an unregistered NFA gun and citizens are not allowed to register NFA guns . It sounds to me like Feinstein crafted this damn bill to purposely incite standoffs between the feds and folks who wo n\'t be willing to give up their guns . The FAQ section of the ATF \'s website could n\'t be clearer : * * * Q : May a private citizen who owns an NFA firearm which is not registered have the firearm registered ? No . The NFA permits only manufacturers , makers , and importers to register firearms . Mere possessors may not register firearms . An unregistered NFA firearm is a contraband firearm , and it is unlawful to possess the weapon . The possessor should contact the nearest ATF office to arrange for its disposition . [ 26 U.S.C. 5861(d ) ] * * * Source - URL_0 Explain to me how you can spin this as they have no intention of coming for people \'s guns ? Granted the Obama administration has not come out in public support of this bill . Regardless there obviously are powerful people who are sponsoring serious legislation that will do just that . I think the millions of gun owners in this country who currently own one of the 120 models listed in the bill have every justification to be concerned . Edit : I call Bullshit on the OP . I would not be suprised in the least if OP is a shill for the administration or directly working for them . What a shit tactic to call anyone concerned about this as someone as delusional as the Tea party "" Death Panel "" crowd . It \'s an attempt to silence honest concern plain and simple .

c7vxsu9,t3_15171r,t3_15171r,7,"['As someone in their 10th year of study : > not interested in any martial aspect . In my personal opinion : Tai Chi is worthless if you are going to completely disregard its roots . Tai Chi is first and foremost a martial art . I know many skilled practitioners that * do not fight * . This does not mean that they do not study Tai Chi as a martial art . TaiJiQuan is transleated as "" Grand Ultimate * Fist * . If you truly mean to study the art , then you must first recognize its roots , and even though you have no interest to fight ( which is where an adept martial artist winds up mentally ) , I would recommend yoga , or simple qigong to Tai Chi , to anyone that wants to ignore the martial roots of tai chi . This is coming from someone that began to study Tai Chi for meditative aspects . Every person I have met that is on the path to understanding Tai Chi recognizes the martial aspects . Every person I have met that ignores the roots of the art , lacks severely in skill , and philosophy . You can not study a martial art , and disregard its entire foundation . The martial aspects of Tai Chi dictate the structure for how the form is utilized . I am not trying to start an argument with this statement , but after a decade of practicing every day , and studying with an amazing teacher , anyone I see that disregards the martial aspects looks like a crazy stoned hippie waving their arms around . Without understanding stances , and the geometry of Tai Chi as a martial art , you \'re missing out on most of the benefits , and it becomes essentially useless on every level . Is it better than sitting on your ass , and eating chips .... yes .... but why not get the most out of it ? Whether you "" believe "" in TCM is irrelevant . If you want to honestly study the art , you need to research it , and understand its roots . Why are you doing what you \'re doing ? If you are willing to completely discount the entire philosophy of tai chi ( whether you believe in it or not ) what do you have left besides a slow dance ? You can go outside , breathe , and randomly wave your arms around . Why even bother with Tai Chi , if you have no interest in * where * it comes from ? "" Chi , "" and "" energy flow "" can mean a lot of different things . Martially it can mean you intent , and how your body structure and alignment ( which are important for the "" health , and balance "" aspects ( physically and mentally ) , and how you efficiently transfer the power of your strike , or neutralize your opponents attack effectively . You can not become a skilled nonpracticing if you refuse to acknowledge these aspects . TCM is a different subject outside the martial aspects of Tai Chi , and the fact that you are would like to dismiss both the Qi Gong , and martial aspects of Tai Chi , would point me in the direction that you might be better off studying something else . Even if you do n\'t "" believe "" you need to understand the philosophy of the purpose of the art . Outside of Tai Chi , you should be careful to dismiss things you have no experience or understanding of , as useless . As a person that requires proof for everything , i have seen things I thought were not only improbable , but impossible . Many herbal concoctions are mixtures of natural occurring chemicals , that have not been honestly , or objectively studied in Western culture to give them "" credibilty . "" As someone with an open mind , I have been willing to try many things . At my school we have a mixture that alleviates bruising . We use this to train our shins , fists , and arms . I have never seen anything whether over the counter , or prescription that can alleviate a bruise . I have tested this by using both arms , and legs , and applying the herbs on one seeing results on one limb , and not the other . Do I know how it works ? No . Do I know it works . Yes . There are also basic remedies that Chinese people keep on hand , that help ailments in ways that would blow your mind . This is not "" magic "" or QiGong , but what I beleive to be simple chemistry that Western doctors are too snobby , to research , and have no marketable value because they are affordable , and effective . So ... your definition of TCM is subjective . If you have done no research into ( and are not interested in ) what Tai Chi is , and where it comes from , and have no intention of approaching the study of the martial art of Tai Chi , then I would say no ... you should stay away . You would be better off with something else . If you are willing to enter into this with an open mind , and investigate the possibilities for yourself , and research the methodology , and reasoning behind why this martial might be useful to you , and what you can learn from studying it , and exposing yourself to an entire culture and philosophy that is centuries old , that has helped countless people across continents and cultures , then you are in for quite an adventure . > I \'m wondering if the steep learning curve is worth it . There is reason people practice this discipline for 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50 years . I have not seen any young people that are adept at Tai Chi . It takes years of patience , and yes the learning curve is worth it . Find yourself a good teacher . Someone that understands Tai Chi , and respects that it is a martial art . You do n\'t have to fight . Tai Chi is about living . Fighting happens to be an aspect of living , but there is always a yield . Know the Yang , stick to the Yin . If you have any questions ... feel free to PM me . What ever you decide to pursue .... you must pursue it with an open mind . At least in the aspect to study its origins and purpose .

Even condos cost around 80k in desirable locations like Florida . You wo n't be able to afford the down payment , and even if you can , you wo n't be able to afford the mortgage .

You wo n't be able to draw a speculative loan at a good interest rate . 3 . The homes need to appreciate a lot in a short period ( less than 1 year ) in order for you to make back your money after capital gains and closing costs ( yeah they exist ) . The only way you can sustain house flipping with small amounts of capital is if the property value is continually fast on the rise , which amounts to speculation . Another way to make money is to buy properties for less than their intrinsic worth and sell them when they appreciate , which requires longer lead times which you obviously do n't have . This method is further made difficult by the nature of housing : there 's no way to easily judge the intrinsic value of a property , since it 's determined fully by the amount others are willing to pay for it . Houses generate no cash flow , so house flipping does n't conform to fundamental analysis . 4 . The entire premise of house flipping rests on not being left with the bag . Here 's the problem : say you buy a house for 100k and sell it for 150k , pocketing 130k after various fees / taxes . Now the problem is all houses in the area are worth 150k , so you need to find another house worth 100k and flip that house . Eventually no more 100k bargains exist , so you need to buy homes at 130k . You continue until you 're left with the bag at some point and ca n't find buyers . Then you lose all your money .

I was always the quiet , well behaved child , getting good grades in school without ever having to study , honors program all through elementary and middle school , all of that . Around my sophomore and junior years of high school , however , I began to get really moody , back and forth bright , elated smiles with the - world - is - mine - to - conquer attitudes and depressing , somber , is - there - even - a - point - to - living ones , in the span of 15 minutes . I never brought it up to anyone because these moods would n\'t last forever , anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours , but I figured that any real depression would last a lot longer than that ( if not permanently ) so I would just get angry and upset with no one to talk to because not even I knew what the heck was going on with me . Increasing amounts of lack of focus , slight hyperactivity , inattentiveness and forgetfulness made me wonder if I did in fact have ADHD like the rest of my family ( come on , what was the chance I was the only one in the family to be "" normal ?

Without perks , a bow is only good for one sneak attack to lower the enemy 's health , but usually not kill the enemy . With all of the perks , a bow can become a full out combat weapon . Not only will it do massive damage , you can run at normal speed with the bow drawn , draw 30 % faster ( for bows such as Daedric , with long draw times , this is a blessing ) , zoom in A LOT , slow down time , paralyze the target , and stagger the target . Those are just the benefits to the archery tree that I can think of off the top of my head . Archery , combined with smithing and enchanting , becomes an insanely over powered skill tree . The best part is : no glitching required . Speaking of smithing , you are dead wrong on saying only the first two points are needed . How on earth are you supposed to make the armor if you do n't have the perk for it ? Also , having all the perks in smithing allows me to make any armor , and double it 's armor rating . The same goes for weapons . A Daedric bow does ( I believe ) only 45 points of base damage . Combine that with you not having any perks in Sneak , you 'll only deal 90 damage from a sneak attack . With all the perks in archery , my bow deals 90 base damage WITHOUT SNEAKING OR SMITHING PERKS . Add the smithing in , my bow deals 180 base damage . Add in the x3 bonus from sneak , I can deal 540 points of damage . Finally , we have enchanting . If you thought that my bow was insane then , you have n't seen anything yet . For enchanting , I took only the middle tree , which boosts skill ratings while wearing the enchanted armor . This is where I may begin to get confusing . Using enchanting , I can enchant 4 pieces of armor with a 25 % boost in smithing . 25%x4=100 % increase . Lets go back to my bow , shall we ? Lets see here . I can double the improvement originally , so 45x2=90 base damage without archery perks . Add in the extra one hundred percent from the smithing ( essentially doubling the damage ) , you get 180 base damage from smithing alone . Add in the perks in archery(double damage ) , I now deal 360 base damage . I 'm not even done yet . I can now enchant 4 pieces of armor with a 40 % damage increase , so 40x4=160 % damage increase . 360x1.6=420 . 420 + 360= 780 . Lets add in the sneak attack bonus now . 780x3=2,340 damage . That will kill everything in game , if I 'm correct . Game over . Wanna know what the best part is ? I could probably get all of this done by level 30 if I worked at it . By that time , I would n't even need to crouch to one shot somebody . I do n't wanna gloat or anything , but assassin is probably the deadliest build out there .

There are two really common endgame builds for wizards : archon and critical mass . Archon builds are primarily for solo farming , while CM builds are good in group play .

You can build a budget CM set for less than a few million , but it wo n't be able to deal very much damage . Archon , on the other hand , is pretty easy to gear with a very limited budget . Here 's the specifics of the gear you might use : weapon : Butcher 's Sickle ( search int , 700 average damage ) 200k source : Triumvirate ( search average damage 180 ) 100k gloves : rare ( search 75 int,50 all res , 7 crit , 30 cd ) 50k bracers : Lacuni Prowlers ( int , vit ) 150k chest / pants / shoulders : rare ( 75 int , 125 vit , 50 all res , max sockets ) 250k belt : rare ( 75 int , 75 vit , life % , 50 all res ) 150k helm : Andariel 's Visage ( seach 150 int , pick up radius , plck the one with the lowest % fire damage taken ) 100k boots : rare ( 75 int , 75 vit , 40 all res , 12 % movement speed ) 100k Throughout , look for + armor or physical resist as bonus stats , if you can . If you ca n't , no big deal . After this , head in game and check your all res / HP - if you 're running around 400 + all res and 25+k HP , you 'll probably be more or less OK . Finally , get some jewelry . rings : rares ( search 3 crit chance , 30 crit damage ) amulet : rare ( search 6 crit chance , 50 crit damage ) When getting these , fill in the gaps in your gear . If you were low on all res or HP , search for those in addition here . If you were fine on those , search for DPS stats instead ( average damage , intelligence . ) There 's tons of jewelry floating around , go nuts and search for many different combinations of terms to find good deals .

If you want to have me get a license to own a gun , fine that is one thing , and in fact that is one thing I have no issue with .

You might get teased to pursue other subjects like the French Revolution because it turns out that the Americans managed to beat the English in part because the French helped the Americans with lots of money and military aid , which in turn helped bankrupt France , which in turn lead to the people of France start to starve , which in turn lead to discontent , etc . Now you have two massive revolutions , well it turns out that some centuries ago that would n't have made a difference but now you have the mobile printing press so now people around the world read about your events .

A softer spring ( like in a luxury car ) will do the opposite and will help absorb more road interference as well as stop the absorber from compressing or resounding too quickly . * Control Arms : control arms are what tie the absorber / spring assembly to the body of the car .

This had a historic purpose when bras were made of inflexible materials , but nowadays it is done primarily so that they can carry a limited range of stock and still make sales . The reason it feels too tight when you are sitting down is because your breast tissue is being pushed into the band by your too small cup . You can see that the band is too big by fastening your bra in the front , and then moving it up so that the band sits underneath your breasts , while keeping the cups on the back . This prevents the cups from pushing your breast tissue into the band , allowing you to see your true underbust size in relation to your band size .

Moses being sent down the river as an infant , Moses being adopted by Pharaoh \'s daughter , Moses standing up to the Egyptian guard and killing him , Moses fighting off the attackers at the well , Moses standing up to the Pharaoh and demanding "" let my people go "" , Moses crossing the Red Sea . His entire life was about hard core choices , in difficult circumstances . Anyhow what this has to do with rights is , rights are a logical construct , that derive from "" human action "" , logical consistency , and equality under the law . When Mises used the phrase "" human action "" as the foundation of his treatise , he never claimed to understand or know the mechanism of human action . Perhaps the mechanism could be discovered by science some day , perhaps it \'s just too complicated to figure out . He just started out with the premise that humans act , and then made logically derived conclusions from there , which include property rights and free market economics . Which was later intellectually expanded upon by Rothbard and Hoppe , to encompass all rights as we understand them , including free speech , free religion , the right to bear arms , and so on ... So while God and free will very strongly implies human action and rights , human action does not necessarily imply free will or God . That \'s why both non - Christians who believe in human action , and Christians who believe in God , can have wide agreement and unity on the concept of rights , or on what is implied and demanded by them . Since rights are rationally and action driven , we can conclude that rights that are ignored or violated , lead to harmful consequence . Many intellectual people can see that things like jumping off a cliff can lead to harmful consequences because they understand the nature of physics , but they fail to see that violating rights leads to harmful consequences because they do n\'t understand the implications of legal equality being ignored or the nature of human action . This is how rights become rights , because a society must respect them in a real way , or fail , and meet predestined doom . So people can safely presume that they are entitled to have certain behaviors and beliefs of theirs allowed ( rights ) , for their judged good , and the good of society .

Aside from the SoTSP , Bee , and now Naruto , there have n\'t really been any Jinchurikis that were best buddies with their tailed beasts ( at least to my knowledge there were n\'t ) .

Bee cut him , punched him , dodged his attacks and eventually * ripped half of his fucking torso off * . This trait of the Sharingan is , as we \'ve been shown multiple times , worthless if the user \'s body can not match the attacker \'s speed . > So what are Naruto \'s options now ? Well lets start out with his Rasengan attacks . First you got ta get to Itachi to hit him which is a problem within itself . Then you have the Yata Mirror , and behind that you have a perfect Susanoo . Let \'s put the fact that the Yata Mirror does n\'t provide 360 degree protection aside . Itachi \'s Susano\'o is * depletable * . He ca n\'t hold it up for too long . Naruto , on the other hand , has much , much , much , much larger chakra reserves and could outlast Itachi \'s Susano\'o . You \'re forgetting Naruto \'s main advantage and Itachi \'s main disadvantage - the huge gap in chakra pools . > I \'m sure he \'d anticipate where the attack will go and let a clone get hit by it , it \'s just Itachi \'s style . > Itachi vs Bijuu Bomb .

There 's a bunch of salt that sits on top and it can be much harsher if you do n't mix it in . I loove love love Ocean Salt though < 3 Based on what you are saying about your hair , this is what I would suggest for you : Rehab shampoo - This stuff is GREAT . It has lots of bright delicious fruits in it to help with shine and to get rid of the excess oil on your scalp . It also has peppermint to really deep clean . But it also has olive oil in it to strengthen hair at LEAST 3x . This is my number 1 go - to shampoo when someone comes in searching for something to combat breakage . This is seriously my absolute favorite shampoo because it does so many great things . R & B Hair Moisturizer - Since you have dry / split ends , this will be your saving grace . Just rub a little bit on your finger tips and then work it through the bottom half of your hair while it 's still slightly damp . The oat milk , banana , and the wonderful nourishing oils will work to smooth the ends and to seal the cuticle . It also adds shine and a wonderful scent :) Honey I Washed the Kids is a GREAT soap ! I love the way it smells . It smells like caramel and honey , and it 's incredibly creamy on your skin . Wonderful :) If you want to try a bath bomb , they 're honestly incredibly worth it ! Butterball is a wonderful bath bomb and it is cheaper than the rest . It smells slightly sweet , but not overpowering . It also has bits of cocoa butter in it so it 's very moisturizing :) Great for those bitter cold winters . Seanik is a great solid shampoo if you are looking for softer locks with more volume :) I love it , it 's really brought out the brightness in my Henna hair dye . The sulfates in LUSH products are in much much lower concentrations as compared to most other soaps / shampoos , and they are more gentle . I would take a LUSH product over a bar of Dove any day . I 'm very happy to hear that you found stuff that works for you , and I 'm so excited for you to discover even more of the store !"", []]",t5_2tqbr,LushCosmetics,1358733050

The proposals that the Obama administration want congress to pass will be an effective ban on certain guns in MA and other states with similar gun laws . That is not fear or paranoia . That is actually happening . * Requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales , including those by private sellers that currently are exempt . * Reinstating and strengthening the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004 . * Eliminating a restriction that requires the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives to allow the importation of weapons that are more than 50 years old . Executive order : * Directing the attorney general to issue a report on the availability and most effective use of new gun safety technologies and challenging the private sector to develop innovative technologies . These will force all private sales to go through a dealer to get a background check . Ma currently has a bill that would try and do this . Here it would cause guns not on the approved roster that do n't also meet certain safety standards ( standards that are complete BS ) to be nontransferable . If they succeed in forcing private sales to go through a dealer , they can do like they have done in MA and ban guns for not meeting safety standards that the executive order calls for . Preventing dealers from selling and transferring those firearms . So if I currently own a gun like a glock which ca nt be sold in MA unless it was made and registered in the state before 1998 , it can never be sold or transferred . What happens to a nontransferable weapon when I pass away ? He wants to ban the importation of older weapons . Right now someone with a C & R license can purchase 50 + year old weapons across state lines without going through a dealer . This would remove a significant amount of firearms from the population further restricting what we can own . Add those to the pile of firearms that will be made nontransferable , they will never even make their way into the country to be purchased . Add in another AWB on top of it . These laws are designed to dry up the supply of firearms to be legally purchased . It has been happening here in MA for years . Forced dealer transfers by requiring private sellers to do a background check will act as a choke point for a large amount of handguns in MA and with a few BS safety standards can effect the whole country .

Since you 're on US , on a budget of less than 1 mil I think you could upgrade every single slot . Here 's a rough guide to gearing , based on my knowledge of witch doctors . The standard WD build nowadays seems to be a variation of the following : Zombie Bears / Acid Cloud - Acid Rain / Sprit Walk - Honored Guest / Horrify - Stalker From here , the other skills are super variable - you can use Soul Harvest - Vengeful Spirit , or add in Gargantuan and Zombie Dogs for pet power , or a primary to address mana concerns . Gruesome Feast / Grave Injustice / Spirit Vessel The last slot is also quite variable . Anyway , here are some gear suggestions : Mojo : Thing of the Deep , 150 avg . damage . This bad boy comes with int , crit , max mana , mana regen , and 20 pick up radius standard . Pretty baller . Weapon : For witch doctors , most of your damage will be based on Zombie Bears . Since you 're mana limited in this respect , you want a slow weapon with high damage , trying to emphasize crit damage and attack speed . Search : int / crit damage / life steal / 680 average damage - should be TONS of results for less than 100k . Spend a bit more here , since you want a baller weapon for sure . Pants / Chest : Search blank int / 125 vit / sockets / 50 all res . Tons of options under 50k here - pick the highest possible all res and int that your can get . Bonus stats = physical resist , armor , fire resist . Belt / Shoulders : Seach blank int / 75 vit / 50 all res / life % . Again , should be tons of options under 50k . If not , drop life % and raise vit . Again , look for phys , fire , armor as bonus stats . Bracers : Search 75 int / 50 all res / 5 crit . Boots : If you 're concerned about survival , search for 75 vit / blank int / 50 all res . If not , try 90 int / 40 all res / blank movement speed . Either way , plenty of fish in the sea . Ok , now run in game and try these pieces on . Make note of your defensive stats - we 'll be aiming for 450 -500 all res , 3500 + armor , and 35k HP . See where you 're at , keeping in mind that sockets can be gemmed with amethysts for more vit . Keep this in mind for the next few pieces : Gloves : 100 + int / 7 + CC / 30 + CD / vit or all res , depending on what you need . Rings : Search 3 + CC / 20 + CD . For the third stat , see what you 're short on . If you want more all res , search for that . More vit ? Search for that . Fine on both ? Search for int or average damage . Play around with these , and look for bargains on bonus stats ( esp . sockets ) . Helm : Search int / crit chance / all res / mana regen , and see what comes up . Right now , there 's a rad one with 40 + all res , 90 int , 4.5 crit and a socket for less than 100k . Ammy : Search 6+CC / 50 + CD . Bonus stats , same as above . Amulets can be funky - sometimes you can get mad deals on all res , vit , or LOH , since people are attached to thinking of them as DPS slots ( for good reason ) .

Those are the basic principles involved in ballistic fingerprinting . It has some HUGE drawbacks though . * You have to recover a pretty perfect bullet in order to compare it to a baseline . * Markings change over time and do nt always produce a match from bullet to bullet . * There are not a whole lot of possible combinations of markings for a given shot .

The ergonomics of an "" assault weapon "" vs a hunting rifle are mostly about personal preference and design . No rifle is designed to be fired from the hip or anywhere other than the shoulder . Firing from the shoulder will always be more accurate than firing from the hip . If you want to talk about hip firing consider how you hold a pistol grip vs a standard rifle stock . If I was going to fire from the hip I would have a much better grip on the weapon with a standard stock than a pistol grip . A pistol grip makes it easier to control full auto when fired from the shoulder , on a semi auto it is less about control and accuracy . If the gun is n\'t full auto then the grip is more about design . Contrary to poplar opinion those "" large capacity magazines "" are actually standard capacity magazines . These rifles were designed to use 20 - 30 round magazines , so having those magazines does not add to the weight and throw off a shot . Magazines below 20 and above 30 are non standard . Most rifles that use a magazine have the magazine in the same spot . If you look at the Image linked in the OP , the bottom 2 rifles are the same gun , the magazine is located in the same place . Notice how the one on top , the AR-15 , also has the magazine located in the same place . Why should ergonomic features be banned on a semi automatic rifle if those features do nothing to make the rifle more deadly . Why should a semi automatic rifle have a special classification when ergonomic features are added to it ? Full autos are already banned , and there is no reason to ever fire a semi auto from the hip . A full auto being sprayed from the hip is one thing , but the pistol grip and stock does not aid in it \'s hip sprayability , if anything it hinders it . Most modern firearms are designed for quick repeat firing . They all have to be able to shoot a bullet as fast as you can pull the trigger . That is an issue of safety and reliability . If a mass shooter has a hunting style rifle he is not at a disadvantage vs an assault weapon . Even if he had a bolt or lever action rifle , or handguns like in columbine . An armed person can hand out a whole lot of hurt when he is attacking unarmed people . 2 Glock 17s with 33 round magazines can be used .

A form will be made available on this website no later than April 15 , 2013 . Under state and federal law , some people are not allowed to possess a weapon , such as convicted felons , individuals who have been involuntarily committed , or individuals currently under an order of protection . These people will not be able to register . There is no fee for registering . The unionized Stazi will be carrying out the orders … and there is no fee for registering , Wow thx ! Q : How does registering my gun compare to getting a handgun license ? A : It is much simpler . To register , all you need to do is fill out a basic form . You do not need to appear in person or provide references or other information that is typically provided during the handgun licensing process . Gotcha ! The state will have all the info they need to track you . This is the step before Confiscation ! Dealers Q : I have guns in my inventory that are now defined as assault weapons and magazines that can contain more than ten rounds . What can I do with them ? A : You can transfer them to another dealer or sell them out of state or to law enforcement . You can also permanently modify these guns and magazines and sell them in state . SP will buy them and then destroy them per Cuomo ’s order with Sheldon Silver and Chuck Schumer giving the heil Hitler salute . Q : If someone paid for a gun before January 15 , 2013 that is now classified as an assault weapon , but the gun has n’t been delivered to the buyer , what do I do ? A : You may still give the gun to the buyer , but it must be registered by April 15 , 2014 . Law abiding citizens will be considered in a criminal act if they choose to decline registration . That is part of their agenda . Q : Is there any background check required for purchasers of ammunition ? A : No . The background check requirement does not take effect until January 15 , 2014 . People will purchase their Ammunition out of state just like people do for cigarettes . There will be a NYS ban on online purchases of ammo , and arms if there is n’t already , not sure . Crimes Q : What are the changes in the law when it comes to crimes performed with illegal guns ? A : The law establishes tougher penalties for those who use illegal guns ( my comment ; anyone who is pro-2nd amend . , and does n’t think it ’s right to register their rightful firearm ) as well as measures to help combat gang violence . Tougher penalties under the law include : · Murder of a first responder who is engaged in his or her duties will become a Class A-1 felony , with a mandatory penalty of life in prison without parole . · Possession of a firearm on school grounds or a school bus will be increased from a misdemeanor to a Class E Felony . My answer . Poor sheep ! NYS public schools are kill zones as I call it . Private School or home School if possible in NYS . · Possession of an unloaded gun will be raised from a misdemeanor to a Class E felony . What the hell does this mean ! · Recklessly injuring a child by a firearm will become a Class D felony . · The purchase of a gun for someone the buyer knows to be disqualified because of a conviction of a crime , an involuntary commitment or other disqualifier , will be raised to a Class D felony from a misdemeanor . This also raised to a class D felony the sale or transfer of a firearm to an individual known to be prohibited from possessing a gun . · Tougher penalties to permit more effective gang prosecutions , allowing a prosecutor to ask for 25 to life ( previously was just 15 years ) for an entire group when a gang is involved in murder . · Using or carrying a firearm during drug trafficking or a violent felony will include a 5 year mandatory minimum sentence if the gun is loaded and a 3½ year mandatory minimum if unloaded .

Dutch 's gang has planted a bomb on the roadside , though , crippling the vehicle and forcing you to proceed on foot . After fighting through Dutch 's gang , Marston pursues Dutch through a network of caves leading out to a ledge where Dutch takes his own life rather than being taken alive . Having fulfilled his end of the bargain , Marston is finally reunited with his wife and son who were being held by two federal agents to extort Marston 's aid in tracking and killing Dutch . His time reconnecting with his family is all too brief , however , as the agents , with the Army again in tow , renege on the deal and return to kill Marston . After holding out long enough to ensure that his wife and son escape and survive , Marston is trapped in his barn and surrounded by armed soldiers . Out of options , John comes out with guns blazing , demonstrating his skills as a Deadeye gunslinger and taking as many men as he can down with him . As the player , you feel all the frustration , betrayal , and shock of the Marstons , and John 's stoic resignation is still tinged with our pain.](/spoiler ) For me , that was the most powerful impact the storytelling in a game has had through a combination of cutscenes , in - game dialogue , character , story , and gameplay .

( This is also a travel tip for people who need to ensure their luggage is not lost , as an airline that looses a luggage with a gun in it is in huge trouble . Some people purchase flare guns for this ) I have never done this , nor do I believe I ever will . International flights require you to check with the country you are entering for their laws , and concealed carry regulations . For example , going into Canada you may have a rifle or a handgun not less than 4 "" in length ( Barrel ) , however you must notify them and arrive at the border with a pre - filled registration paper and pay a fee for a temporary pass that allows you to bring the weapon into the country . Hand guns require a higher fee than rifles . If you move houses , the best thing to do is to travel with them secured , unloaded with you in your car . You can not mail guns unless you mail them directly to an FFL . This depends also with the local state regulations . If you are moving within the state you are fine , just check with your local county and city laws for any differences in concealed carry / weapon transfer . Generally is n\'t an issue though . If you need to fly to your next place and it \'s out of state , I am not sure . Workplaces will generally not allow you to bring a gun to work , however it also depends where you work . But generally the answer is no , do n\'t bring your guns to work .

Also have an old towel I lay everything out on , and gloves for easy clean - up . I also have snap caps ( allows you to safely fire your gun without damaging it - this is not real ammunition , basically an object in the shape of a bullet with a bit of rubber on the end ) for each gun for when I dry fire it to make sure I \'ve reassembled correctly .

The bike is a 54 cm but I think a 52 cm would have fit me better . The bike was such a great deal I could n't really pass it up after months of searching so I just went with it . I am not doing anything competitive , but I commute about a mile to school and I wish to do some recreational rides in the future . So on to the question . When I ride on the hoods and drops of the [ handlebars ] ( URL_2 ) , my arms feel like they are a stretching a bit too far to be comfortable . My arms are pretty much locked straight when riding and I feel much more comfortable when I rest my hands on the curve of the top part of the handlebar . How would I fix this ? I was thinking stem length or handle bar height but I really have no idea . 3 . If you look back at the [ handlebar picture ] ( URL_2 ) , you 'll see that the previous owner installed some brake levers along with the Sora brifters . Is there an easy way to remove this ? It seems like there 's no easy way to take it off since its attached and I would have to disassemble the handlebar tape and brifters to remove them . 4 . Ever since I got this bike , I 've been super careful on the road with it . It seems very fragile since I 've never owned a light aluminum road bike before so every time I hit a crack in the road I feel like I might bend a spoke or knock the wheel out of true . Is this something I have to worry about ? And would it be okay if I road the bike off a curb ? 5 . Any suggestions for wide pedal straps or pedals with cages ? I have a short commute to school so I rather not go with clipless ( and its also too expensive ) . I like wide pedal straps more since they 're easier to put on and they wo n't scratch some of my shoes as much . Something functional and inexpensive would be nice . 6 . Is it worth to change anything on the bike ? I know its a very inexpensive bike , but it 'll probably be the only one I have for a couple of years . I do n't want to make any expensive changes to it , but if I find good deals on used parts I might change some things on it . Anything in particular I should look out for ? Fork , wheels , tires , etc .

If they fly fast and/or high , or are in a Liberator , the best you can do is harass them so they leave ( unless the pilot is an utter idiot and hangs about on no health ) . ESFs are too difficult to reliably hit at high speeds and altitudes , and Liberators have far too much health with Flak Armour for you to kill them before they kill you or fly off . * G2A Rockets : Although you can get a lock out to about 500 m , the rocket does n't have enough fuel to actually hit at that range . Fire when they get closer ( ~300 m ) , and if they do n't use flares or pull one of the many simple maneuvers that cause G2A missiles to miss then you 'll do a nice chunk of damage . G2As are more useful when used en masse or when fired at enemies distracted by other flak or friendly fighters . * Gunfire ( ESF only ): Works quite well en masse , generally ineffective when solo unless you 're playing HA ( and even then it 'll take a couple of full drums to down an aircraft ) . It 's great for confirming kills in big fights though - the number of aircraft I see take a rocket then flee on a sliver of health when there are 20 or 30 infantry standing about that could have shot them is maddening . * Dumbfire missiles : Hovering aircraft are VERY easy meat for the NS Decimator thanks to its hefty 2000 base damage - exactly half of a Liberator 's health , and enough to one - shot an ESF . It 's also not affected by flak armour , seeing as it 's an anti - tank weapon , so it always deals full damage . If they 're camping you in a spawn , grab your Decimator and fire it up directly into the belly of the gunship , or straight into the face of a hovering rocket podder . It requires the pilot to be a bit dense ( they should n't ever hover stationary , but a lot of them do ) but I 've killed a large number of them this way . Personal best was killing three fully loaded TR Liberators and a Mosquito with 7 successive rockets when being camped by a heavy air zerg - they were all hovering stationary only a couple of hundred meters up , in full view of the one - way spawn shields ( except the Mossie , he was just unlucky enough to fly directly into a rocket I aimed at one of the gunships as he passed beneath it ) . Also , cert into the orders channel and request friendly air cover . If more people did this , there would probably be a lot less complaining about Liberators by infantry and a lot more complaining about ESFs by Liberators . Do n't spam up the channel though ."", []]",t5_2s48x,Planetside,1358873389

c821ivr,t3_1734zg,t3_1734zg,3,"['One Second After by William Forstchen ! John Matherson is a professor of history at the local Montreat Christian College . A retired U.S. Army Colonel , he had moved to Black Mountain with his late wife , a native of the town , when she was dying from cancer . The widowed father of two daughters and a collegiate professor , Matherson is well - respected within the community . At 4:50 p.m. ( 16:50 ) Eastern Standard Time , on the first day described in the book \'s narration , the phone lines in the town suddenly go dead , along with all the electrical appliances . Just a second before , everything worked ; but now , just one second after , virtually nothing seems to work . Within hours it becomes clear to the residents of Black Mountain that this is no ordinary blackout , and they come to the realization that the power may remain off for a very long time . Every modern electrical device is disabled , destroyed by what Matherson is beginning to suspect is an electromagnetic pulse ( EMP ) attack on the United States by unknown attackers . The contiguous United States has , in an instant , been thrown back into the 19th century . However , the narration in the book points out that 21st century people are not at all equipped to live under 19th century conditions . Later on , Matherson remarks that the survivors have the technology of the early 16th century . Matherson \'s immediate concern is his twelve - year - old daughter , who has Type 1 diabetes . Without a constant supply of insulin , which requires refrigeration , she will die . The story \'s focus shifts quickly to how the community , as a whole , reacts . Matherson is a respected outsider , and his military experience , standing as collegiate professor , and level - headedness are appreciated by the town \'s residents . There are hundreds of stranded motorists whose cars and trucks have simply rolled to a halt on the nearby Interstate highway . Those people make their way into town , where some of them are clearly unwanted by the locals . There is an immediate growing concern about food ; the leaders of the community soon begin wondering how these several thousand people going to be fed for any appreciable length of time . No refrigerators or freezers are running . No trucks are bringing in fresh supplies every day . Concerns immediately arise about the nursing home in town where Matherson \'s elderly cancer - stricken father - in - law resides . The elderly and frail need refrigerated medicines , and many require constant nursing care . The EMP has disabled the nursing home \'s standby generator , which can not be started . There are no AM / FM radio broadcasts , no television , no Internet , and thus , no communication with anyone outside the town is possible . However , two months later , a working antique telephone is set up to connect Black Mountain with the nearby town of Swannanoa , North Carolina . The family of Matherson \'s late wife are small - scale car collectors who happen to own a 1959 Ford Edsel , in addition to a Ford Mustang . The two cars are so old that the EMP did not affect them because they have no modern EMP - sensitive electronics , such as transistors . Another local resident owns a vintage airplane that later becomes very useful , as it too is so old that it has no vulnerable electronics . Without modern sanitation and supplies , diseases surge . Minor wounds become seriously infected , and the community has soon exhausted its supply of antibiotics . The social order in Black Mountain begins to break down . It is too late in the year to plant and harvest crops , which is a moot point as few people in the area know how to farm anyway . Suddenly , skills that have n\'t been needed in several generations have become critically necessary . The town must organize its young and able - bodied to defend itself against a marauding band of cannibals , who eventually attack the community , resulting in a violent and deadly battle . After a while , the extreme shortages of food require difficult choices regarding rationing ; who gets how much food , and which people are to be deliberately underfed to the point of starvation . Increasingly , Matherson is forced by circumstances to assume a growing leadership role as the situation continues to deteriorate . Matherson , along with a few others , try their best to maintain a balance between the multiple necessities of rationing scarce resources , maintaining law and order in addition to individual freedom , as well as personal responsibility and moral behavior in the midst of deeply deteriorating physical and social conditions . One year later , the U.S. military arrives to rebuild and aid the town . It is revealed that the EMP that devastated the contiguous United States was generated by three nuclear missiles launched from offshore container ships . One was launched from the Gulf of Mexico and detonated in the upper atmosphere over Utah , Kansas , and Ohio . The container ship was sunk by an explosion immediately after the missile launch ; no indication remained of who was directly responsible for the attacks . Another missile was fired from off the Icelandic coast and detonated over Russia . Another nuclear missile was detonated over Japan and South Korea . The U.S. government is said to have believed that an alliance between Iran and North Korea was responsible for the attacks , and that the United States attacked Iran and North Korea with nuclear weapons in retaliation . It was also mentioned that the U.S. withdrew all of its overseas military forces back to the United States to aid in rebuilding and humanitarian work . It is also revealed that the EMP attack brought down Air Force One , killing the U.S. President . One year after the EMP attack , the United States is described as having 30 million survivors , down ninety percent from an original pre - attack population of 300 million . The People \'s Republic of China is occupying the U.S. west coast with 500,000 - strong occupation force , and Mexico has Texas and the American Southwest under military occupation , as a protectorate against China . The book also describes the increasingly intimate relationship Matherson develops with a single and child - less nurse , Makala Turner , who was stranded by the pulse . "" Die - off "" sequences The book \'s premise sets the stage for a series of "" die - offs "" . The first takes place within a week ( those in hospitals and assisted living ) . After about 15 days , salmonella - induced typhoid fever and cholera set in from eating tainted food , drinking tainted water , and generally poor sanitation . Americans have lived in an environment of easy hygiene , sterilization , and antibiotics , making them prime targets for third - world diseases . The lack of bathing and poor diet will lead to rampant feminine hygiene infections ; deep cuts , rusty nail punctures , and dog bites go untreated with antibiotics , tetanus shots , or rabies treatment as more die from common infections . Critical medical supply and food thieves and others are executed in public as enforcement of martial law . In 30 days , cardiac and other drug - dependent patients die off . In 60 or so days , the pacemaker and Type I diabetics patients begin to die off ( although John \'s young daughter manages to survive until Day 163 ) .

c8230db,t3_174ahb,t3_174ahb,5,"['I liked this a lot , and generally agree with it . There are a few things I \'d like to point out , not necessarily in disagreement . Firstly , heroes like Sven and Gyrocopter are strong by virtue of them having a reliable , secondary source of damage . Storm Bolt deals 325 and the Barrage / Missile combo deals about 900 damage if you pour all the rockets into one target ; Missile is taken at 210 damage , nearly half of the max possible 440 damage - about 700 range from its origin . Sven was played as a "" semicarry "" ganker with items like Blink for his massive initiation ability and a steroid in God \'s Strength allowing him to scale into midgame , if not late . Gyro is a new - ish hero but I believe his status as a carry was not really cemented until he received his Flak Cannon buff ; prior to this , he was somewhat a burst - damage nuker of sorts . So that might explain , despite their "" carry "" status , why Sven and Gyro were picked - as nukers with potential carry power . Secondly , on Luna ; she is quite out - of - place on that list . If one looks at the next 10 heroes , only Weaver has significant spell - damage ; the rest rely heavily on their autoattacks to deal damage . On the other hand , Luna \'s earlygame power rests in Lucent Beam \'s spammability , allowing her to deal significant spell damage along with Eclipse . Of course , Lunar Blessing also gives her pretty significant autoattack damage . My point is - it seems strange , does it not , that she is considered more farm - reliant than FV , AM and Lycan , considering all she needs to be effective in early - mid combat is Aquila and Drums as compared to the Battlefuries , Mjollnirs and BKBs ? I \'m not quite sure what to make of it . My initial reaction is that , because of the methodology ( GPM \'s effect on winrate ) , the chart reflects not only who is farm - dependent , but also who * scales well with farm * - and one can then point out Moon Glaives \'s unparalleled ability in structure destruction from pure autoattacks , scaling well because of the immense number of bounces , as well as , beyond the traditional carries , justifying Drow and Huskar \'s winrates - with farm , they can affect the game immensely , albeit not ( yet ) at a competitive level . If one takes these two points into account then it becomes easy to justify the bottom 30 heroes - their damage output and contribution is spell - based , and so all they need is either regeneration ( to effectively contribute their spells ) or tankiness ( so they do n\'t die before they can cast ) . Consequently , the bottom few scale the least well with farm because farm contributes little to their ability to contribute ( although one could make an argument for Heart of Tarrasque being pretty overpowered on Wisp , # 88 ) whereas the 60s want and * need * - 2 different things - a pretty decent amount of farm to contribute effectively . Nonetheless this is great and it is actually a list that efficiently breaks down the hero pool into # 1 to # 5 farm priorities with a bit of fuzzing inbetween ; I sha n\'t talk too much about the lane analysis because I have nothing to contribute there .', []]",t5_2s580,DotA2,1358949677

Here 's a few of those : BRACERS OF AZARASHI Aura moderate transmutation ; CL 14th Slot wrists ; Weight 1 lb . These bracers are made of dire seal leather , polar bear fur , and interlocking shark teeth . Created only by the shamans of the Ul - Angorn , they are given to their most prominent hunters to celebrate their great spirit quests . The bracers are imbued with three totem spirits ( the seal , the shark , and the polar bear ) , who allow the wearer to channel their powers , granting an enhancement bonus to a physical ability score and a spell - like ability usable 3 times per day . Only two of the spirits can channel their powers at a given time . The two spirits can be re - dedicated with an 8 hour ritual that requires 300 gp worth of rare incense to be burned . The three totem spirits are : Seal : +4 Dex , touch of the sea Shark : +4 Str , keen senses Polar Bear : +4 Con , endure elements The Apocrypha of Xitonus This set of engraved glass plates is contained in a steel case . They can only be read by magical light . They are written in an archaic form of Aquan , and weigh 8 pounds . An individual who reads this tome , which requires 32 hours over a minimum of 4 days , gains the spell - like ability to use Project Image once per day . After they are read , the plates crack and are forever ruined . Weight : 8 lb . QUICKSILVER GAUNTLETS Aura moderate transmutation ; CL 12th Slot wrist ( special ) ; Weight 10 lb . The life ’s work of a brilliant gnomish whitesmith , this unassuming pair of +1 mithral gauntlets holds a powerful magic . When the command word is spoken , the quicksilver gauntlets flows like living water . As a move actions , the magical metal of the gauntlets may be reformed as nearly any weapon or piece of equipment imaginable . Simple items ( such as those without moving parts ) may be created freely , while more complex items ( such as a weapon cord , locked gauntlet , or firearm ) may require an DC 15 Craft check with the appropriate skill . The mass of the gauntlet does not change , and items created can not exceed 10 pounds . The gauntlets may take the form of two individual items , or a single larger item . Single weapons and armor created with the gauntlets have a +2 enhancement bonus and are treated as mithral ( this bonus is reduced to +1 if the gauntlets are used to create two or more weapons . The quicksilver gauntlets may be used to create ranged weapons and ammunition , but each unit of ammunition fired deals 1 hit point of damage to the quicksilver gauntlets ( Hardness does not apply ) . The gauntlets may be reformed into a new shape up to 6 times per day , and each reformation lasts up to 1 hour . When not in use , the quicksilver gauntlets resume their natural form of a pair of gauntlets . The gauntlets each have a Hardness of 17 and 20 hit points . Heart of the Storm Lord Karaxk’Üm This still - beating elemental heart was torn from the body of a powerful denzin of the elemental planes , who searches for it still . A living being may consume the heart as a full - round action to gain the Storm Lord ’s power . The next time the creature who devoured the heart takes the form of an elemental ( via a spell , class ability , magical item , etc ) , they gain the simple giant template ( Size increase by one category ; natural armor bonus increases by +3 ; +4 size bonus to Str and Con , – 2 Dex ) . This lasts for one hour or until the creature takes on a new form or returns to their original form . When the creature who devoured the heart next returns to their original form , they forcibly vomit the intact heart up , causing the creature to become nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1d4 rounds after . The heart may be devoured once per day ."", []]",t5_2qh2s,rpg,1359038519

In response to the thought experiment , I would say you do not need a cell phone or a computer to exercise your right to Free Speech , and if Congress chose to restrict sales to those items , an argument that this limits the right to free speech would probably lose . I think there is a big difference between the first amendment right to speech and the second amendment right to arms . The freedom of speech is not necessarily something that can only be expressed through a specific noun . Speech is an action . This action is of course restricted as well though : you ca n\'t incite a riot , you ca n\'t yell "" fire "" in a crowded place , etc . However , the second amendment right is more specific since its actions are in reference to a noun . "" Keep "" and "" Bear "" being the actions that relate to the noun "" Arms . "" In this regard , I think "" the right to keep and bear Arms , "" refers specifically to what that right entails , whereas "" freedom of speech "" is completely ambiguous . I \'m probably not saying this very clearly . But how I think about it is , the Second Amendment specifically refers to a noun , and certain actions relating to that noun that can not be restricted , but says nothing about the noun itself . The First Amendment refers to an action that can not be abridged , similar to how the actions in the 2nd can not be abridged , but the first is not limited to any noun .

The ATF is n\'t hard to deal with as long as you have a clean record . It can take anywhere from 6 months to a year to get your FFL and class 3 completed . Keep in mind , they want you to have a physical location prior to applying . Contact your local field agent , and start the conversation with them . They are incredibly helpful . The only utility i have found from having an online presence is advertising for hard to come by fire arms . I have a fair amount of class 3s that no one would know about unless i was online . General online sales are quite painful . Maintaining a "" shopping cart "" on a webpage adds considerable costs , and the shpping , insuring and keeping track of FFLs that goes along with it can be more of a headache than its worth . If you are high volume , with several employees , this will increase your revenue . if you \'re getting into it because you like firearms and like the people , this part will drive you crazy . Ranges are REALLY tough to get into . Depending on the state , there are a number of laws regarding lead , bullet traps , etc . Up front costs are very high , well into the low to mid 6 figures for a decent range . hopefully this helps', []]",t5_2qhc8,guns,1359150942

Also , groups wanting to ban these rifles have for years purposely or through ignorance spread misinformation about them to aid their cause . The National Shooting Sports Foundation asks you to be an informed gun owner and to use the following facts to correct misconceptions about these rifles . Remember , that if AR-15 - style modern sporting rifles are banned , your favorite traditional - looking hunting or target shooting semi - automatic firearm could be banned , too . AR-15 - platform rifles are among the most popular firearms being sold . They are today \'s modern sporting rifle . The AR in "" AR-15 "" rifle stands for ArmaLite rifle , after the company that developed it in the 1950s . "" AR "" does NOT stand for "" assault rifle "" or "" automatic rifle . "" AR-15 - style rifles are NOT "" assault weapons "" or "" assault rifles . "" An assault rifle is fully automatic -- a machine gun . Automatic firearms have been severely restricted from civilian ownership since 1934 . If someone calls an AR-15 - style rifle an "" assault weapon , "" he or she either supports banning these firearms or does not understand their function and sporting use , or both . Please correct them . "" Assault weapon "" is a political term created by California anti - gun legislators to ban some semi - automatic rifles there in the 1980s . AR-15 - style rifles look like military rifles , such as the M-16 , but function like other semi - automatic civilian sporting firearms , firing only one round with each pull of the trigger . Versions of modern sporting rifles are legal to own in all 50 states , provided the purchaser passes the mandatory FBI background check required for all retail firearm purchasers .

It \'s not necessary , but [ * very * flavourful for Legends to have a title ] ( URL_5 ) . * I also gave him * * Legendary Creature * * Status , and changed his type to Human Assassin . Shapeshifter Assassin might be a good one as well . Named creatures are now always Legendary . If you have someone who \'s got an actor who gets credited with at least a "" guest starring "" , it would be a Legendary Creature , especially if there \'s tons of fan art and Tumblr fandoms for that character . * I changed his rarity to * * Mythic * * ; yeah , Legends exist at Rare ( and Uncommon even , if we count * Kamigawa * , but we do n\'t ) , but unrestricted removal is very powerful . * I kept the spirit of what you were trying to do , as opposed to the abusable way that Tanis laid it out . * * Whenever * * is a magic word in , well , Magic . This means that you \'ll only be able to sacrifice a creature * if he would die * . The way Tanis laid it out , you could put up multiple regeneration shields just by saccing creatures . We do n\'t need another Falkenrath Aristocrat . * I \'m not sure what you want to do with * Valaar Morghulis * . It \'s an Ability Word , which means that it has no rules associated with it , but they always follow a theme . Bloodrush is a series of mechanics that let you pump an attacking creature , Morbid works if a creature died this turn , etcetera . Usually the term either puts a restriction on the ability , only making the ability work if some conditions are met ( Metalcraft for instance ) or just tying together a series of similar mechanics ( Channel , Kinship ) that otherwise have no ties and are n\'t keywords . It could just be moving Death Counters , or it could be about destroying a creature . * I also took the end step part out . What that would do is create a delayed trigger ability , triggering on the controller \'s end step . It could be responded to , and even countered with something like [ Trickbind ] ( URL_4 ) or [ Voidslime ] ( URL_0 ) . With the templating fixed , there \'s a dearth of room , so I decided to go with the simpler route of having it be an automatic destruction of a creature . * I lowered the cost for * Valaar Morghulis * , because this is a Legendary Creature we \'re talking about , and a Mythic Rare at that . * With all this in mind , I made his mana cost * * { B / R}{B / R}{B / R } * * . It means he can only be played in a deck with strong colour strength , whether it \'s Rakdos , mono - Black , or mono - Red . That said , after reading his Wiki page , it * really * feels like * * { B / U}{B / U}{B / U } * * would be more fitting . The reason I changed it to hybrid mana is because otherwise he \'d have a Gold frame , not a hybrid one . That said , in retrospect , he probably would be Gold more than he would Hybrid . But I just woke up . * * [ Second Option ] ( URL_8 ) * * , played around with the mana cost , tried to make the abilities cleaner . * First , I changed it to +1/+1 counters . Not as flavourful , but probably better in the long run . It \'s also very abusable . * I changed his Power and Toughness to go better with +1/+1 counters . He \'s now a 1/0 , This means that once he kills his last creature , he \'ll die himself . * I probably should have given him a relevant ability , but I just gave him the quote I saw ElectricPaper use . * I personally think this version is the cleanest . I also took away the sacrifice and regenerate effect , partly to clear the card up , and partly because I had n\'t really seen anything on the wiki that would work with that . He did n\'t "" regenerate "" , it \'s more that his damage was prevented , and nobody died in his place but the enemies . So I kept the \' debt \' at three . * He also requires the least amount of up - front payment to kill something , since it takes from his health . I was tempted to limit it to tapped creatures , but meh . This version is probably the worst . Too aggressively costed , too powerful , and too , too broken ( at least he \'s a Human , or he \'d be stupid good with [ Zombie Mikaeus ] ( URL_7 ) * * [ Third Option ] ( URL_1 ) * * , cleaned up and simplified more . * Gave him first strike . Assassins should have first strike . Just a preference . If he was Green I \'d give him Deathtouch . Although this is one of those \' gold versus hybrid \' things . If he was Gold , he probably could have had Deathtouch , but you do n\'t want to put Deathtouch in a mono - red deck . I \'m starting to see what Maro means when he says there are more restrictions on a Hybrid card . * No regeneration shield , but back to death counters . * His ability now requires a tap ; he ca n\'t kill something the turn he comes into play , he ca n\'t kill but one thing a turn . * Back to being a 2/1 * * SUGGESTIONS * * First , I \'d say that he really should be BLUE and not RED . I know he has red hair , but ... he \'s Blue . He \'s basically Dimir from what I \'m reading . Also , try to look at some other cards that do similar things . First thing that came to mind was [ Bounty Hunter ] ( URL_3 ) . Something similar to [ Bomb Squad ] ( URL_9 ) might also work . I was thinking something along the lines of "" at the beginning of your end step , destroy all other creatures with death counters "" or something similar , but that would be very wordy , and end up being four abilities . Although it could also be a delayed trigger set up by the * Valaar Morghulis * ability , meaning if counters are moved from Jaqen to another creature in a turn Jaqen has n\'t used the ability , nothing would happen to the other creature ; but if Jaqen does activate his ability , the creature would die . In other words , if you [ Fate Transfer ] ( URL_6 ) from Jaqen to ... a Soldier token , the soldier token would n\'t die . But if after Regenerating Jaqen you activated his ability , removed a counter , and put it on something else , the soldier * would * then die . Sometimes the mechanics of an ability can become very weird and crazy . I see this as a plus in the game . "" It \'s not a bug , it \'s a feature "" . Anyway , I digress . One last thing , though , is that I think maybe his regeneration ability is n\'t really necessary . While flavorful , it \'s inelegant , and elegance is something you should always strive for . So , in summary : * Try Blue instead of Red ; try Gold instead of Hybrid ( you technically did have a Gold card , btw , but since you made the frame Hybrid , I used the hybrid mechanic ) * Read as many cards as you can to internalize the templating . * Definitely make him a Legendary Creature and an Assassin . I \'d also suggest his race be either Shapeshifter or Human . Not Soldier . * Rethink the way you want him to work ; I \'d suggest losing the regenerate and focusing on assassinating . * Do n\'t be like Plaxico Burress : Understand how triggers work .', ['http://magiccards.info/di/en/137.html', 'http://i.imgur.com/0p0UZl5.png', 'http://i.imgur.com/d8IczbJ.png', 'http://magiccards.info/tp/en/4.html', 'http://magiccards.info/ts/en/88.html', 'http://magiccards.info/query?q=The+t%3A%22Legendary+Creature%22&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname', 'http://magiccards.info/shm/en/161.html', 'http://magiccards.info/dka/en/70.html', 'http://i.imgur.com/jCaYPUj.png', 'http://magiccards.info/od/en/179.html']]",t5_2s9n5,gaymers,1359200552

During the drama section of the class , we had a unit about stage makeup and we learned how to make stage blood out of peanut butter , corn syrup , and red food dye . My genius mind took this information home with a plan : I made a batch of stage blood and then convinced my three year old brother to let me cover him in it and then told him to pretend to be asleep . I picked him up ( he \'s pretending to be sleeping ) and I forced myself to start crying . I took him outside and started yelling for my mom , who was a few houses down sitting on our neighbor \'s front porch talking to them . I ran over to her with my "" unconscious "" brother in my arms and was screaming and crying for help and that I did n\'t know what happened and that I just found him this way . Now , in my juvenile 12 year old mind , I had hopped to scare her , but in no way was I expecting the reaction I got . My mom FLIPPED OUT . She immediately shot up and started screaming and running around . She kept yelling things like "" HOSPITAL "" and "" EMERGENCY "" and "" OH NO . "" She really lost it . While she was shouting incoherently , I just froze where I stood to watch her reaction . I was so full of pride that I had tricked her and after a few seconds I just let my little brother fall down into the grass and started laughing so hard I had to lay down on the grass as well . In my mind I was the greatest prankster ever . Meanwhile , my mom has just watched me deposit my little brother onto the neighbor \'s yard and is now yelling at me to pick him up and take him to the car so we can go to the emergency room . As I lie there laughing she just keps yelling , with her voice sounding somehow more distressed and pleading each time . Eventually I see the realization of what is actually happening spread across her face . Suffice it to say that she was not happy with me for a very , very long time . * * TL;DR - I once covered my 3 year old brother in fake blood and used him to scare the crap out of my mom just for the heck of it . * *', []]",t5_2qh1i,AskReddit,1359227210

When he next runs up and lines up for the parry , delay your second R2 just a moment and catch them . This same type of playstyle can also be effective at killing backstab fishers by smashing them with an R2 when they run up for a backstab , provided they have low enough poise .

Their origin goes back to the post - WWII reconstruction efforts in France in 1950s . At the time , Algeria ( a predominantly Muslim population ) was under French rule as a colony . The colonial governors sent droves of Algerian Muslims to the mainland as blue collar workers to aid in the reconstruction . French welcomed them with open arms ( they needed as many workers as they could get , after all ) . They arrived with French approval in order to work . And because they were working and living there , they did what every human being does : formed into communities , banded together to practice their beliefs , constructed mosques . The families that immigrated had kids in France , who then needed education so they needed the government to open up schools within their communities . So on and so forth . After the reconstruction was over , blue collar jobs started drying up very quickly especially as technology advanced . So all these Algerians that they brought in as immigrants , who now had families and lives in France , found themselves unable to find jobs . They became increasingly poor . The government did n't give a shred of care for the people they brought in , so they got sidelined , pushed out , forced into projects and the ghettos . They did n't integrate into the society , not because they did n't want to , but because they were n't given the opportunity to . So before you make this ignorant and racist assertions , study the goddamn history and educate yourself . French Muslims did n't magically appear out of thin air .

c84ejyt,t3_17c7sc,t1_c84e9c6,2,"['> I understand what you \'re trying to say that statistically , guns are relatively safe . So are airplanes - mile by mile , they \'re the safest form of travel . They also have a large amount of safety measures in place . Because they \'re so safe , should we feel comfortable relaxing them ? The reason that we do n\'t is because when something happens to a plane , the possible consequences of even a single failure are too high . Airplanes in and of themselves are not "" safe . "" They are "" safe "" because they are operated safely . And the actual data shows that the same is true for firearms . Accidental firearm deaths are rare , especially when you measure against population data and gun ownership rates . The vast majority of firearms will not be used negligently , will not be party to an accidental death , and also will not be used in the commission of a homicide . A big problem with your analysis is that you see a problem ( gun related homicide ) , and you say "" Something needs to be done . "" And well , comprehensive background checks , magazine restrictions , assault weapons bans , etc . are "" something , "" but you \'re not considering their effectiveness against the negative consequences they pose for actual gun owners . Assault weapons bans are the worst , because they have no measurable impact on crime , and negatively effect millions of gun owners who own an "" assault weapon . "" Magazine restrictions are ineffective , because the vast majority of homicides are not committed with the aid of "" high capacity mags "" however defined — for instance , the top weapon used in the commission of homicides is a revolver that fires .38 special cartridges . It is not an "" assault weapon "" , nor is it augmented by extended mags , as revolvers have cylinders that generally have a 5 - 6 round capacity . Furthermore , there is no evidence that mass shootings would be any less deadly absent high capacity mags , as reloading a mag takes no more than 2 - 3 seconds , and killers can simply carry more of them , as Cho did when he carried out the Virginia Tech Massacre . Background checks have not at all been effective in deterring crime , as they are easily subverted through straw purchases , or theft ( I need n\'t remind you that Lanza did not buy his weapons ) . The laws you advocate would largely be symbolic , because they would likely do very little to deter actual criminals .

If so , depending upon the size of your party , you might at least manage to hide and rest inside a Rope Trick . Not as good as escaping , but solves the immediate problem of where you sleep . Similarly , Alarm plus Hold Portal or Arcane Lock might at least be able to secure a room from entry by those hunting you so you could sleep the night .... of course the enemy might have Knock . Secure Shelter might also do this , or you might fortify the area you are sleeping in with spells like Wall of Stone or Persistent Image , but all of these are not as good as the rope - trick IMHO . You could send for help with Sending or Dream . Assuming the physical structure of the castle is not air - tight , and not under water , Gaseous Form might let you escape by traveling through cracks in the walls too small for the things hunting you to be able to follow through ... of course if the things hunting your are incoporeal then that wo n\'t help . Phantom Steed might give your party enough raw speed to simply out run your hunters . Beast Shape-1 or appropriate illusions might let you fool your way out by apearing to be a dog or other harmless animal that the people hunting you would not be concerned with ... but your magical auras could make this a very risky plan ... if they can see invisibility thent hey can almost certainly see auras too . Depending upon the structure and nature of the castle there might be an underwater route of escape in which Water Breathing might work . Higher level beast shape spells might let you take on the form of a tiny fish , and then swim to safety via the castles plumbing ( if it has any ) . Of course , if the spell runs out before you have left the pipes , this might be profoundly unfortunate . I assume there are no windows or other ways to easily break out of the castle . Assuming this castle is made of stone Stone Shape , Pass Wall , or Transmute Rock to Mud might create an opening in an outer wall allowing you to fly / walk / feather - fall to safety . Similarly , an adamantine weapon might achieve this effect . If you do n\'t know Transmute Rock to Mud , and the party does not have an adamantine weapon , you can try one last gasp at this strategy : Ask the DM if the walls of the castle are made of marble or limestone . If so , you can make an argument that they should be suseptable to acid damage via the rules on page 174 of the core rules : * "" Vulnerability to Certain Attacks : Certain attacks are especially successful against some objects . In such cases , attacks deal double their normal damage and may ignore the object ’s hardness . "" * If so , acid splash applied repeatedly may eventually burn through the wall . Stone has 15 HP per inch of thickness , so a 5 foot thick wall has 15x12x5=900 HP . Acid splash deals an average of 1.5 damage per casting and there 10 rounds per minute = 15 damage per minute = 900 damage per hour . Therfore , in rock that is succeptable to acid damage ( and thus hardness and damage halving does no apply ) , acid splash will allow you to burrow at a rate of 5 feet per hour .

If the law were implemented without tracking of each individual gun , then person A can just come back and either say that he sold his gun to B and that the background check came back just fine , or that he has no idea who person B is and how person B got the weapon . The reason that you can get away with requiring a background check at a gun shop is that the owner of the shop is required to keep records of the transactions he runs . This is for tax reasons , but also because the ATF says so . The difference between a gun shop owner and a private citizen is huge . Gun shop owners depend on their sales being legal to survive financially . That is not the case with private citizens . Most people might only sell a gun every couple years at the most . Records get lost and then you eventually have a giant cluster fuck . No matter how you slice it , if you require private citizens to get background checks , you end up having to track what guns they have . NOW ... lets talk about the nationwide permit . If you require everyone in the country to get a permit to own a weapon , you end up doing the same thing . You have a database of people who own weapons . Confiscation here we come . Right now , we have a situation where every state can decide how to handle the issue . I personally live in a state where my government does not keep records on my own private matters .

I picked up what appeared to be a staff of some sort , and quickly discovered it pulled apart into two small swords . This is where I fucked up .

He dropped to the ground and had coughed up blood within less than a minute , so I called the ambulance . The ambulance came with the police and after speaking to the people in the apartment they arrested me and brought me to booking . This is what happened during the court case . I was arrested , because , I called the ambulance and the cops that came with decided they had enough for an arrest . The reason I was charged was , as far as the ADA determined , Jason was n\'t in the actual act of rape , and even if he had been planning to , I should have called the cops , instead I used deadly force in a situation that called for a less drastic response . Initially they were determined to take me to trial and attempt for a sixty month prison sentence . Then my lawyer , ( a real lawyer , not a public defender ) , had his investigator contact some witnesses . They made statements that he then brought to the prosecution . They responded by offering 21 months incarceration , with fifteen years probation . I refused their offer , and took my attorney \'s advice to counter offer the same sentence with no probation . The prosecutor accepted and we made a plea bargain . The day I went to court to have the plea agreement reviewed and accepted by the judge , the judge ruled that the sentence was to harsh considering the circumstances , and that I was the one to call the ambulance . So he asked the prosecutor was prepared to accept a lighter sentence recommended by the court . The prosecutor agreed and I was returned to my cell .

Being able to deal 4 damage with 1 spell has proven to be critical for closing out games in my testing . B / R burn typically already plays 16 - 20 bolts ( depends on if they play shard volley ) so having another bolt / incinerate is n't what the deck wants . Even though this is burn , we still should be conscious of curve ... Consider FotBH the fatty bomb in modern burn . Different in legacy though where we do n't need to extra damage because we can already cast Price / Fireblast ... But in modern we 're really winning off the back of bolts , so it 's nice to have a spell that deals more then 3 ( plus its a better topdeck late game )"", []]",t5_2utkz,spikes,1359661834
