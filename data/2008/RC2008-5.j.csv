The Security Council seems to be demanding that Iran cease enrichment activities , but such a demand is * outside * the bounds of the NPT . It seems to me that 1 ) Iran is mostly compliant with it , with compliance being a matter of definition and 2 ) certain states are making demands of Iran that extend well beyond the NPT . In particular see the Feb 22 IAEA report : URL_1 > The Agency has been able to continue to verify the non - diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran . Iran has provided the Agency with access to declared nuclear material and has provided the required nuclear material accountancy reports in connection with declared nuclear material and activities . Iran has also responded to questions and provided clarifications and amplifications on the issues raised in the context of the work plan , with the exception of the alleged studies . Iran has provided access to individuals in response to the Agency ’s requests . Although direct access has not been provided to individuals said to be associated with the alleged studies , responses have been provided in writing to some of the Agency ’s questions . > The Agency has been able to conclude that answers provided by Iran , in accordance with the work plan , are consistent with its findings — in the case of the polonium-210 experiments and the Gchine mine — or are not inconsistent with its findings — in the case of the contamination at the technical university and the procurement activities of the former Head of PHRC . Therefore , the Agency considers those questions no longer outstanding at this stage . However , the Agency continues , in accordance with its procedures and practices , to seek corroboration of its findings and to verify these issues as part of its verification of the completeness of Iran ’s declarations . > The one major remaining issue relevant to the nature of Iran ’s nuclear programme is the alleged studies on the green salt project , high explosives testing and the missile re - entry vehicle . This is a matter of serious concern and critical to an assessment of a possible military dimension to Iran ’s nuclear programme .

Congress places charges against the accused . No US Attorney needed . Congress directs its own Sergeant - at - Arms to arrest the accused . No US Marshal needed .
