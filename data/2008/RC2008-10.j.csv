Is this the writing of a psychotic serial killer , or of a 12 yr old with an imagination ? Running through the forest , I did n’t have time to consider the beauty that the night and the wilderness might have had . There was no time to marvel at such things . There was only time to flee for your life . The infant in my arms started to struggle and whine against my gliding run . "" Hush , Markuss , "" I whispered . There was no time to stop and to tend to him if we intended to live through this . The yelling from behind was growing slowly , yet steadily , louder . In just a few moments , if I did n’t hurry , they would see us as clearly as I would see my shadow . Markuss , still a very tiny infant , was still very , very strong and intelligent . Not even two months old yet and he was able to stand for a bit without falling down . I hope they stop soon , I thought . If they kept coming at us with this pace , they would undeniably catch up with us . My body was n’t strong enough to go on for much longer or farther . I was still week . The transformation was indeed , a risky one if you went about it wrong . Markuss ceased struggling when the shouting started to die away , but I kept running . Their kind does n\'t give up that easy . There was no way that they were finished . Birds of the nighttime sky , they were called . Oh why had n\'t anyone told me where the territory line was ? Note to self : do n’t ever go that far from home again . I heard wings in the distance , growing louder . They were faster than the running , but I was nearly home now . The Coven , a cave in the side of a bluff near the ocean , was n\'t a mile farther now . And they knew that . Those leeches knew that and they were n\'t going to give up until I , the threat to their kind , was dead and buried . A little closer now . They could surely hear me coming , right ? So , why was n’t anyone coming to help me ? Then it hit me . Hunting . They \'re all out hunting and the only left was … Felix . He was surely asleep by now and would n\'t hear me if I shouted through the biggest conch shell on that beach , into his ear . Oh great ! I thought . Wait a second . Is that … no it ca nt be . Pluto ? I listened to the sound of running paws that were coming my way . Yes . It was defiantly Pluto . Finally ! I thought . Some help at last ! In less than two seconds , Pluto was by my side and I by his . He faced the threat while I was facing the Coven . "" Shadow , "" was all he said . "" Pluto . I- "" he held up his hand in silence . "" It \'s fine . Do n’t worry about it . No one had told you . I will handle this then we will return home . Deal ? "" he turned and smiled at me . A genuine smile . Not that of a sadist . "" Deal .

I walked to the nearest tree , flung Markuss onto my front , and plopped down right then and there . The wings grew louder and louder until , finally , they stopped .

Their fangs glistened in the moonlight and I shivered . To have one of those drinking your … I shuddered . "" Pluto ! Step aside . This one is ours , "" the smallest one said .
