The bad news is , it 's going to take time because we literally ca n't even start until we wean some significant proportion of programmers off of shared - state traditional threading . I was getting ready to write some counter - argument about how threading is n't really that hard , right up to your last paragraph , when you basically said what I was going to anyway . :-) Using parallelism * in general * has plenty of unsolved problems associated with it , particularly in the area of generating it automatically in a compiler with minimal explicit support from a programmer . However , using basic parallelism such as what is needed for the kind of UI responsiveness we 're talking about is easy . It requires that a developer actually learn their subject , and it requires that a project adopt some design standards . But it is not rocket science , and plenty of non - genius programmers can do it . The problem we have is that there are just too many wannabe programmers who got into it during the .com boom , and a whole generation of relatively inexperienced programmers who sincerely want to learn but were let down by the poor standard of modern CS / SE degrees and employers who think providing real training is too expensive . If you do n't know the basics of writing code , you can get away with hacking stuff most of the time in a trivial web app , but you ca n't with things like parallelism issues . We also have a problem with certain trendy agile methods , where people who drank the Kool - Aid but missed the point basically eschew any kind of up - front design and try to do the entire thing incrementally . Aside from being a catastrophic hit on productivity in the long run , this leaves you ill - equipped to work with things like parallelism that inherently have a significant influence on possibly quite large parts of your code . There is n't anything really new in this . We had the same thing a few years back with things like exceptions in C++ , where again if you design things properly and follow a few basic guidelines you can keep the simple stuff simple , but even one or two clueless developers can screw up the whole thing . We have the same thing today in security for web applications , too . I think you have a point about shared - state programming as well , but for the sorts of UI issues mentioned here , I doubt that is really the problem . A lack of understanding in non - guru programmers is the problem , and better training ( in academia , on courses , via mentoring , whatever ) is the solution ."", []]",t5_2fwo,programming,1220373746

Here is the story . * * * * * * * * * * I could write books on the shit that I have seen but here are just a few highlights : Over the denial of a second scoop of ice cream I have had a 3 year old yell “ You have to give it to me , you work for me ! ” . I slapped the shit out of him . Okay , I did n’t . But I really really wanted to . I have had a 4 year old throw a two hour tantrum , akin to an epileptic seizure , because she wanted a different kind of goggles to wear swimming . She was not happy with the five pairs at her disposal . Swimming by the way , in her private pool directly next to the tennis courts . This particular little bitch also made up a song while perusing through her 20 or so bikinis ( ! ! ) about how rich she was . “ I ’m rich . I ’m rich . Soooo rich ! Richer than you . Richer than you . I am so rich ” . The sad thing is that it ’s true . I have watched mothers freak out in awe over the fact that the kid I was babysitting used the foreign words of ‘ please ’ and ‘ thank you ’ . I have witnessed another 3 year old refuse to get in the pool at a group swimming lesson by screaming at a handful of adults . And instead of getting thrown in the pool as any normal parent would do ( right ? ) , her mother rushed to her aid citing her therapists ’ views on never making little Sally do anything she did n’t feel safe doing . What the fuck ? Sally ’s tears abruptly stopped and while cradled in her mother ’s codependent arms , she showed the menacing smile of a 40 year old gold digger . Cut throat manipulation to the end . In that instant I got scared . Parents are lovingly creating and cultivating their very own hell . Over hours of analysis , I have broken down why these parents are letting their kids do whatever the fuck they want with zero consequences . A ) GUILT . The parents work all of the time , have full time nannies , and therefore try to make up for it by never saying No . Add in a divorce to the mix and the problems double . Add in two divorces and , well you do the math . B ) STUPIDITY . The parents are stupid assholes . C ) WHITE TRASH . The parents were raised with no class , education , or foresight to buy a fucking parenting book . D ) YUPPIE HIPPIES . These parents believe that their children should follow their hearts and not be influenced by “ our ” preconceived notion of what is right or wrong . This can be the deadliest kind of parent because they are so fucking smug and self - righteous about it . Makes you want to puke on their $ 500 moccasins .
