The refusal to unload the ship has more to do with current political dynamics in South Africa than with any principle by a trade union . Currently , the trade union ( COSATU and the trade unions affiliated with this ) controls the ANC ( i.e. they have the majority of people in the National Executive Committee and their man ( Jacob Zuma ) is president of the ANC ) . This shift in balance happened in Polokwane , Desember 2007 . The current national leadership of the country is still of the old guard ( i.e. Mbeki and the current cabinet & parliament ) . The new leadership in the ANC will only completely take over in the 2009 elections . So , refusing to unload the ships is a way that the leftist faction can show their power and defy the current leaders . You should clearly note that COSATU ’s main man and the next president of SA ( Jacob Zuma ) was not adverse to * * buying huge quantities of unnecessary foreign arms * * and * * taking bribes from the arms companies * * . * This dispels your myth that the Trade Union is showing more principle than private enterprise . * He is rotten to the core . Of the new members of the ANC national executive committee ( i.e. the leftists ) , something like 6 were already found guilty in corruption in the past , and 7 are under investigation for corruption ( i.e. the majority is corrupt ) . --- On a side note , have you wondered who alerted the world of this arms shipment ? It was a guy called Martin Welz . He runs his own investigative magazine ( A private enterprise in your words ) called [ noseweek ] ( URL_0 ) . He took the risk in uncovering this arms deal . He also took * * significant risks * * in uncovering corruption in South Africa over the past 15 years . This included numerous exposes of arms deals in which [ Jacob Zuma ] ( URL_1 ) ( COSATUs main man ) were involved . He has been sued numerous times and has received several death threats – but he is still fairly persistent in his work .
