c04far5,t3_6o7v7,t1_c04f66g,8,"[""Here 's the actual article since the stupid web site has popups : Dragon Skin Deconstructed The recent controversy over Dragon Skin body armor has raised far more questions than answers . In one sense , it shows that the Army is serious about getting its troops the best armor available . In another sense , it shows how the media can royally get things wrong – and in getting it wrong can get troops killed . How ? Because they can create the impression that something is effective , when it really is n't . The Dragon Skin armor was intended to provide better all - around protection against incoming fire . One problem with most protective vests is that there are places where the protective ceramic plates for the Interceptor armor currently in service do n't extend . This has caused the deaths of policemen in the U.S. and military personnel overseas . Dragon Skin was intended to provide better protection through the use of many smaller ceramic , tiles that overlapped , providing a flexible armor . One American TV network broadcast material that seemed to indicate that Dragon Skin performed better than the current Interceptor . However , the Army has now released the results of other tests , done by an independent lab in 2006 , which showed that Dragon Skin armor failed in a number of areas , including those concerning high temperatures , often after one or two shots . This is not a good thing in combat . Furthermore , the ceramic tiles have proven to be fragile – far more so than the Interceptor 's ceramic plates . The other problem for Dragon Skin is weight : It is about 20 pounds heavier than the 28 pound Interceptor Armor . This is not a minor detail for the poor grunts – it 's a major problem . The troops also have to carry a loaded M16 or M4 rifle , plus a number of spare clips for that weapon ( usually six , but sometimes more ) . If their M16 or M4 has the M203 grenade launcher , they are carrying the grenades for that . They also tend to carry a loaded M9 pistol , and a couple of spare clips for that as well . Not to mention a first - aid kit , Camelbak or canteens full of water , knife , hand grenades ( usually three or four ) , MRE , cans of silly string ( to find trip wires ) , radio , and other gear ( to include notebooks , pens , and a helmet ) . This could mean a soldier gets tired sooner when wearing Dragon Skin , and more prone to heat related injuries in hot climates . If a soldier wearing Dragon Skin is wounded , the Dragon Skin means that there is 20 pounds more for a medic to drag to cover . The Army has prohibited the use of Dragon Skin by soldiers – largely due to these problems . The problem the Army now faces is the fact that Dragon Skin has a lot of Congressional support . The manufacturer of Dragon Skin has claimed that the Army is lying – in essence claiming the Army rigged the tests . In fact , the Army did the tests last year at the insistence of Congress – who wanted the armor to be given a chance . Now that the armor has failed , the manufacturer is going to the court of public opinion to overturn the verdict of the Army , based on its tests . Now , the Army is caught in a battle to not only save the lives of its troops , but the reputation of those who test equipment for the troops ."", []]",t5_2qh1e,videos,1213994908
