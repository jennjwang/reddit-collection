That way , should they need to run a chain - of - ownership check ( in either direction ) , you do n\'t give them a reason to come into your house . Should the transfer be with a * non*-bordering state , it is generally expected that you would ship the firearm from dealer to dealer , to avoid the possibility of the firearm crossing into a county that does not allow that type of weapon .

c058jq0,t3_6yu4c,t1_c058if8,2,"[""I came to a very similar conclusion as the previous two posters when I was in my early teens , around twelve I believe . I was watching the news and a natural disaster had happened somewhere in the world ; people had dead or dying family in their arms and were crying to the sky for God . I had always been a doubter of God , my parents had always convinced me from an early age to question everything I was told , and to learn for myself . Watching this scene , it came to me : religion is the answer to a huge underlying flaw ( or side - effect ) in the human design . Humans are a curious species , as we constantly evolve we constantly seek the answers to questions . At a mundane level , humans could simply reproduce . Always do as we have done for thousands of years before , building fires and hunting . However , for some unknown reason , human 's are n't like this . We seek change , we seek answers , often we seek questions . We crave understanding , and many such as myself believe this is a survival mechanism , the eternal strive to change , so that our species can grow stronger . To put it as simply as I can , the flaw , or side - effect , is that humans need answers , period . Constantly evolving , changing , and questioning means we constantly endeavor to shine a light on unknown topics . Often we can answer these questions simply , and quickly . However , when we have no answer , and no obvious means to solve the question at hand ( and there is countless evidence in every aspect of history ) someone makes an answer up . Why ? Many different reasons . Hundreds ... thousands . The most obvious answer is Power . Those that have the answers , in all aspect of history , are superiors in the human species . Having an answer to an unresolved question is a sign of superior intelligence , and here 's where the second flaw in the Human species comes in : often humans do n't question the credibility of an answer . It could be the social dynamics in play , where they are convinced without fact , or it could be that people simply do n't want to fact check . If there is an easy answer , one that will stifle that specific question , and make them feel comfortable enough to move on , they will believe it to be absolute fact - often to the point of defending this fact because they do n't want to face the consequences of it being false . If it 's a small question at play , then it means more work . Often some humans are happy to do this work , and every day we see breakthroughs in technology where undisputed ' fact ' has been debunked . It is with this understanding that many false prophets or leaders in history accrued huge power ( and still do ) . It is why , for so long in our past , elders of a tribe lead from what is understood to be wisdom - the ability to answer questions sufficiently . However consider Religion . It is n't a single answer to a single question . It 's a compound answer to a large number of questions . It is efficient , in the way that one movement can answer all current and future questions . It is a perfect band - aid fix to the human flaw . Then considering how long humans have used religion as an answer to questions . Consider how ingrained it is in society , the unwillingness and inability of the enormous majority of the world population to have the required educational knowledge , resources and time to sufficiently answer the questions that different religions answers for us . Religions , for most people , are a subscription service that appease our inbuilt desire for answers , to the extent that makes us comfortable enough to focus on other areas of life without worry of consequence . Now , after considering all of the above , imagine the horrific anarchy that would break in the world , should the impossible happen , and Religion no longer played its role .
