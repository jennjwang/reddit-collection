6vzv,t3_7lbrr,t1_6k6l,2,"['Ah , yes . Labor * hours * . But since it is obvious that in using labor hours , the LTV implies that the slowest and laziest workers should produce the most valuable items , what are the advocates of the theory forced to do ? They use the * average * number of hours . That way , even if we can find examples of low valued goods that were produced using many many labor hours , no matter , we \'ll just ignore these workers and say no , what matters is the * average * number of hours . Well , what if there are goods that are only produced by * one company * , and this company is composed of particularly slow workers ? One can not utilize any average because there is only the one company . For example , we can even use the words of David Ricardo , who was a proponent of the LTV : > There are some commodities , the value of which is determined by their scarcity alone . No labour can increase the quantity of such goods , and therefore their value can not be lowered by an increased supply . Rare statues and pictures , scarce books and coins , wines of a peculiar quality , which can be made only from grapes grown on a particular soil , of which there is a very limited quantity , are all of this description . Even Ricardo realized the limitations of the LTV . Now , the LTV not only does not apply to all goods , but it makes some very specific and unrealistic assumptions , as I already said before . For example , it requires that the rate of profit in all lines of business is the same ( will never happen as long as consumers keep changing their tastes ) ; it also requires all lines if business to have the same amount of capital invested to sales revenues , i.e. capital turnover ( which will also never happen as long as technology changes ) ; it also requires that all firms have the same proportion of costs broken down into labor and machinery / materials ; finally it requires that there is only one level of skill in terms of performing labor , and one level of wage rate ( which you call the average ) . Now , if all these assumptions , through the miracle of probability , somehow find their way to being held true for a length of time ( which is so unlikely it might as well be ignored for all practical purposes ) , then yes , the value of good will be determined by the amount of labor that went into making those goods . But are you going to think the LTV is true simply because it could be true if these assumptions are true , but they never will be true ? Remember , if you read the paper , you would have known that the authors make a number of unrealistic assumptions in their model , such as the ones I gave above . In other words , the paper you cited is * not * , I repeat * not * studying reality as it is , rather it is trying to * impose * a theoretical and unrealistic model onto reality , hoping it will stick . Do n\'t kid yourself into thinking that this paper somehow proves what reality is . It does n\'t . One can not say anything about reality if one ignores parts of it out of "" simplicity "" or "" convenience "" . Let me say this again , because it seems that you , like the original developers of the LTV before you , seem to * want * to believe in it , regardless of what reality is showing you : The paper does not "" verify "" the validity of the LTV empirically . Not when the paper makes * unrealistic * assumptions in order to find a statistical relationships between a data set of labor and a data set of prices . For example , I could tell you that there is a statistical relationship between rapists and innocent children , and therefore one is causing the other to exist . I could say that both have arms , legs , eyes , teeth , hair , legs , etc , and that with all this "" evidence "" of similarity they must be related to each other somehow , but of course I would have to ignore some important key facts between the two . But if my agenda is to show everyone else that I think innocent children are responsible for rapists existing , then if I used regressions , I could assume anything anyway and find a correlation . This is exactly what the authors of the paper are doing . The authors are wishing away important economic facts that disprove the LTV , all so that they can prove the alleged existence of the LTV ! Now , I did n\'t want to have to lay out such a detailed response to your post , because it is such a waste of time to have to show you how the LTV is false , so I did it for the benefit of anyone else who wants to know .

Other that getting your facts totally wrong you did a good job . * * I WAS INCORRECT ABOUT THE SILINCER * * Unlike conventional firearms , each change of possession or ownership of a Title 2 weapon ( silencer , machine gun , sawed - off shotgun , pengun , etc . ) must be approved in advance by BATF . This includes not only the sale of such a weapon , but also the act of giving or loaning it to another person . Failure to comply can result in a $ 250,000 fine , 10 years in prison , or both . Although the weapon can be moved by its registered owner within the owner 's state or residence , transportation across state lines requires prior BATF approval . These requirements were instituted by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and were incorporated into the Gun Control Act of 1968 . To the best of our knowledge , silencers are legal for private ownership in the following states : AL , AR , AK , AZ , CO , CT , FL , GA , ID , IN , KS , KY , LA , ME , MD , MS , MT , NE , NV , NH , NM , NC , ND , OH , OK , OR , PA , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , WA , WV , WI , and WY . Additionally , they maybe owned by Class 3 dealers and Class 2 manufacturers ( but not individuals ) in : CA , IA , KS , MA , MO , and MI . Territorial law prohibits possession in the Territories and Possessions of the United States . There are no known restrictions on governmental ownership . If your state is not listed , check with your local office of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , & Firearms or your state 's Attorney General . If they are not legal in your state of residence , we can not sell to you . Please do not ask us to violate state or federal law . As with any firearm , an individual owner must take possession through a licensed dealer in his state of residence . In the case of Title 2 weapons ( silencers , machine guns , etc . ) , the dealer must be what is known as a class 3 dealer , meaning that he has paid an annual special occupational tax in conjunction with his firearms license to permit him to deal in Title 2 weapons without paying the individual $ 200 transfer tax on each weapon . The $ 200 transfer tax is assessed each time a Title 2 weapon changes hands . The exceptions are to ( or from ) a governmental agency or a class 3 dealer . Interestingly , many class 3 dealers do not have a storefront and deal in these weapons as a sideline .. Each time a Title 2 weapon changes hands , the transfer must be approved in advance by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco & Firearms . It normally takes 4 - 5 weeks for BATF to approve the transfer between dealers or to law enforcement agencies , and the transfer to individuals requires 3 - 4 months . The procedure for obtaining one of our suppressors is to order the unit through your dealer . We can help you find a class 3 dealer in your home state if you are unable to find one . We suggest that you first check our dealer page . With the exception of government or law enforcement agencies , we can not do individual sales of silencers . Your dealer may require prepayment or ( on rare occasions ) ask that you pay us directly . We then transfer the weapon to your class 3 dealer . Your dealer will then assist you in completing the necessary paperwork to transfer the weapon to you . This will include your submitting fingerprints and two passport size photos on your application . In addition , your local chief law enforcement officer ( sheriff or chief of police ) will need to sign the application . Along with your $ 200 transfer tax , the application is sent to BATF . When the application is approved ( and not before ) , your dealer turns over possession to you . Your dealer may charge a fee for handling of the weapon . We are not in the business of being a sales tax collector for states other than Idaho , but we do not encourage your avoidance of sales or use taxes . If you are eligible to own any conventional firearm , you are also eligible to own a Title 2 weapon provided that there are no state laws prohibiting such ownership . This means basically that you must be free of all felony convictions and be over 21 years of age . Your dealer can usually help you find a suitable law enforcement signature in the rare instance where your sheriff is personally anti - gun and refuses to sign your application . Your other option is to form a corporation , which does not require a law enforcement signature . Federal law prohibits exportation of silencers except to governmental agencies with an End User Certificate . Please contact us by telephone for further details if you represent a foreign government agency . URL_0"", ['http://www.gem-tech.com/legal.html']]",t5_6,reddit.com,1229282625
