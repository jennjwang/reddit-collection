c065iem,t3_7axv0,t3_7axv0,3,"['Raleigh is a great place to live except that they keep cutting up neighborhoods by adding highways , or causing housing prices to plummet because they build a newer better housing addition next to yours . The schools suck in some areas , so people are prone to use the private schools , which are slightly pricey . Downtown Raleigh also has a good bit of night time crime , unfortunately , so stay close to the restaurants , carry a weapon with a permit ( or at least some mace ) , avoid certain areas , and try to walk with a buddy . But other than that , the restaurants are great , the quality of life and friendly people are great , the work atmosphere is great , the climate is decent , some really good housing deals can be had , and sometimes you can work out a decent traffic situation if you live sort of close to your workplace or can work from home . Rental properties there are waaaaay overpriced , so avoid those . Research Triangle Park ( a huge place for jobs ) is nearby , but the roads are clogged to it , housing near it is astronomical in price , and it has very lousy restaurant options at lunch time .
