c03g3cc,t3_6c1nw,t1_c03fzkv,2,"[""> to get a legal fully automatic you have to get a special permit that is pretty expensive and has to be renewed each year . You 're a little confused . There is a $ 200 one time tax upon transfer of a class III weapon as defined by the National Firearms Act of 1934 ( which means fully automatic for the purposes of this discussion ) . There is no permit per say , but you need to obtain authorization to transfer the firearm from the Federal government , and your ownership is registered . There is no recurring fee . Note , however , that state laws vary , and may place other restrictions , fees , or outright bans on Class III firearms . Massachusetts , for example , requires obtaining a state Machine Gun License in order to possess a fully automatic firearm . Also note that each Class III firearm must be registered , independently from the registration of who owns the firearm , in order to be transferable . No new Class III firearms may be legally registered , so you can not possess a new one . This makes the supply of transferable Class III weapons finite , and causes their prices on the current market to be astronomical . For instance , you 'll likely pay about $ 10,000 for an M16A1 , while the almost identical AR15A1 which is semi - auto and therefore not Class III would likely cost you about $ 1,000 ."", []]",t5_2qh0u,pics,1205523796
